Procedure,The 757 fleet (and possibly others) has a deferral that allows the aircraft to operate for a specific number of cycles if a passenger cell phone or other electronic device falls down a gap in the cabin sidewall into the cargo pit and cannot be located. Maintenance usually tries to look for the phone; to include disassembling some of the cargo pit panels - but if they can't find it in a 'reasonable' amount of time then a deferral is created and additional flights are authorized.The FAA website says this about devices with lithium batteries: 'Devices containing lithium metal batteries or lithium-ion batteries; including - but not limited to - smartphones; tablets; cameras and laptops; should be kept in carry-on baggage. If these devices are packed in checked baggage; they should be turned completely off; protected from accidental activation and packed so they are protected from damage.'We have provisions for Dangerous Goods being shipped as freight; being used by crew on the airplane; as part of installed equipment; and being carried by passengers or crew on their person; in carry-on bags; and in checked bags. There are no Dangerous Goods provisions providing for lost dangerous goods floating around the airplane somewhere.The concern here is the potential for damage and subsequent fire. We won't even let a passenger move a seat if they drop their phone in the seat - yet somehow; it's okay to drop a phone into the cargo area where it could easily be damaged by the cargo loading system or something else? How is this safe? Or even legal? If a lost device with lithium battery gets crushed and catches on fire; we are not going to be able to fight that fire.I'd like to know specifically what kind of risk analysis (if any) was done for this deferral.
Human Factors,Detected an odor onboard the aircraft; similar to burning Lithium Ion battery. After takeoff I noticed there's [smoke] or a cloud around the exit row. After confirming it with a aft FA (Flight Attendant); called the Captain and I told him there's a smoke [area] and I'm going to check it [out]. Put the lights on and I started opening the overhead [bins]; to check if there's anything on fire and also under the seats as well as [asking] the passengers to remove their mask and so they can confirm [if] there's a smell in [area]. One of the passenger sitting in 14A told me he had Lithium Ion batteries in his bag. I grabbed the bag and opened it and I checked the battery however there's smoke coming out of his bag and neither the batteries are hot either. I tried to keep the Captain updated with the same information above. The smell lasted about 3 to 5 minutes and disappeared after that. Then we prepared the cabin for [a precautionary air return].
Procedure,Aircraft X was a PBI lander on the SHRVY1 arrival. The Pilot checked on with normal speed until RACNO; then published speed. The Pilot asked for normal speed along the arrival; to which I approved until TARTY (the PBI boundary fix); then published speeds. Aircraft Y was a ZZZ-TPA flight at FL180; on course.As Aircraft X made the turn at RACNO; the conflict alert began to flash. Aircraft X was already leaving FL190 in a descent per the arrival; and the separation was not lost at this point. I asked Aircraft X to expedite through and report leaving 17;000. I then called the traffic to him and asked him to report Aircraft Y in sight. He reported the aircraft insight as he entered the 3 mile bubble around Aircraft Y. I instructed him to maintain visual separation to which he responded with the appropriate response. No further incident occurred between these aircraft.This was a mistake on my part. I had a hoop on Aircraft Y specifically for this traffic and didn't get back around to Aircraft X to stop him due to the volume of the sector. I need to be more proactive and attentive with the low flights that cross the SHRVY arrival.Fatigue likely played some role in this event as our entire area has worked incredibly hard and for many hours during the holiday week. We've also had many controllers out; lowering our staffing even more. This is in no way an excuse for the error; merely a factor.
Aircraft,Left HYD QTY EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting system) level at 17;000 ft. Quantity indicated 0. Pressure normal. Lost left A/P (Autopilot). [Requested priority handling] and requested climb to [FL] 280 to VMC. Stopped climb in at FL 230 VMC. Ran L HYD QTY checklist. Weather good at ZZZ so continued to uneventful landing on XXR.
Aircraft,Delayed reporting after Captain submitted [report]. Realized I should submit [a report] as well. Normal arrival into ZZZ. Snowstorm the previous night and into the morning. Ground taxi behind Aircraft Y with Captain riding the brakes. Taxiways with some snow and ice. Captain called for #2 engine shutdown. After arriving near the gate and lined up for a straight-in taxi; Captain set the parking brake; waiting for Ground crew to guide us in for the remaining 100 yards to the gate. Once directed by Ground crew; Captain released the parking brake and began to add power. No movement was noted and the Captain added more power; thinking that there was snow or ice preventing us from moving. I looked to checked that the parking brake was released and no message was displayed. I then looked at the pressure gauge and saw the needles pegged at 3000 psi; but was unable to recognize the discrepancy before the plane broke free with the asymmetric thrust and skidded in a 150-degree right hand turn. Once stopped; we confirmed that the needles were at 3000 psi with the brakes released. The Captain cycled the parking brake and the pressure returned to normal. With Ramp coordination; we continued our right-hand turn and returned to the gate normally. The brake issue was not reported via maintenance report since indications had return to normal. Follow-on flight crew was at the gate and we gave a verbal report of what happened with the brakes.
Aircraft,Flight diversion occurred to ZZZ due to an enroute failure of the APU Generator. The #1 engine generator was initially on placard bringing the flight down to one single AC power source. No non-normal situation exists in the Flight Manual; but is trained that a single AC sources requires diversion to the nearest suitable airport. The Dispatcher contacted the Operations Manager immediately after the flight crew reported the event. I was notified of the event by calling the Dispatch to inquire about the flight status when [Software Program] alerted that the flight destined to ZZZ1 was diverting to ZZZ1; which was incorrect; but usually indicates something abnormal may be happening.Per 737 Flight Manual 'Landing at Nearest Suitable Airport' section; there are specific situations where pilot should plan to land at the nearest suitable airport to include 'Electrical - Only one AC power source remains.' No calls were made to the Maintenance Director or Chief Dispatcher until the diversion was in progress. Per the Dispatcher's Manual under the Dispatch Emergency/Irregular Checklist the Dispatcher should notify the Maintenance Director if the diversion to the nearest suitable airport is required. This also is in direct contravention to the Dispatcher's Manual for notification of any inflight notification of mechanical issues as well as the Dispatchers Manual Notification during irregular operations.The Flight Crew did [request priority handling] on arrival which was only discovered after I requested the Dispatcher get briefed by the flight. Failure to notify the Maintenance Director could have resulted in the [Company process] not being issued or company indication via Company process that [priority was requested] for a Operator flight.I have spoken with the Dispatcher for the flight to discuss the events in a post-review. After arrival in ZZZ the Director asked if I would issue the [Company Process]. I replied in the affirmative and requested the Director to have the Operations Managers advise the Maintenance Director when a similar significant event occurs. I was answered with silence.
Airport,We landed Runway 32 in ITH; Tower was reporting Runways as condition 5;5;5; and there were no NOTAMS or reports of poor or NIL braking anywhere on the field. We were assigned taxi route C-A Ramp and I determined that braking action on Runways and Taxiways was good and relayed this to Tower after exiting C. Upon exiting A and taxing onto RAMP; it became apparent that we were sliding across a patch of ice and I was unable to slow the aircraft using brakes or to steer using the tiller or rudder inputs. At this point idle thrust was causing the aircraft to accelerate over the patch of ice and the nose was beginning to veer to the left. I shut down the left engine which stopped the aircraft from veering further left and prevented us from accelerating; but we continued to slide forward. I then shut down he right engine and with all thrust removed I was able to use the brakes to bring the aircraft to a full stop. We remained approximately 100 ft. on all sides of the aircraft from anything that we could have hit; no damage or injuries resulted from the slide. Ops dumped sand on the ramp and urged us to restart the engines and taxi to the Gate under our own power. I discussed with Dispatch and told them that I felt uncomfortable with that plan due to concerns of FOD ingestion and Ramp condition. Dispatch agreed and told Ops that we would need to find another way. Ops made the decision to deplane the passengers on foot; and the XX passengers were escorted across the ramp and into the Terminal (approx 50 yards). After more than an hour; on-call Maintenance arrived and towed the aircraft to the Gate.
Aircraft,While at Gate XX during heavy wet snow with wind blowing 10-15 kts. 90 degrees from the right side; the APU tripped off line 3 separate times. At some point; we also noticed zero duct pressure. The mechanic found no issues [and] suggested shutting the APU down for several minutes. Upon restart; pressure was normal for approximately 10 minutes; then it started to decrease again. [Contributing factors were] heavy wet snow; [flying] in direct right crosswind; [and] possible issue with design of MAX APU inlet. [I suggest] publishing a note in AOM or somewhere to let crews know this is a possibility on the 737-MAX and have Boeing examine this scenario.
Ambiguous,Leaving the CDF (Central Deice Facility) we were given taxi instructions of Zulu; Golf; cross [Runway] 4L; hold short of [Taxiway] TT for a [Runway] 27L departure.  There was light snowfall at the time and local Tower had just turned the airport around to a west flow. As we left the CDF; Taxiway Zulu remained unplowed. We were able to use the blue taxiway edge post lights as guidance.  At that time; those lights were the only means of navigating that taxiway. Any and all pavement markings were indiscernible. The taxi was slow and methodical due to the conditions. It was very dark over on that side of the airport and difficult to see. As soon as we noticed we were slightly north of the [Taxiway] Golf intersection; we stopped the aircraft. At no time did we encroach onto [Runway] 27L/9R as the runway edge lights provided us guidance. ATC immediately queried us as to our position and asked if we were over the hold short line. As there was no way to tell by looking at the airport environment due to the snowfall; we used the AMM (Airport Moving Map) in our Jeppesen Charts which we both had already in use. The chart shows the hold short line well south of the [Taxiway] Golf intersection. According to the chart we had absolutely passed it; but we would have anyway if we had turned right onto [Taxiway] Golf to make our way to the [Taxiway] TT intersection. There was no way to see where the actual markings were on the concrete. While we did taxi slightly past the [Taxiway] Golf intersection due to the conditions and focusing on centerline discipline; I cannot tell you if we actually passed the hold short line that I assume is painted correctly on the ground. There were no lights flashing to denote the hold short line either. Also; there are 10 intersections to that runway; the AMM only shows 4 hold short lines. We were given instructions to taxi across [Runway] 9R and given a number to call. Eventually after taxiing to the active; we took off with no further issues. We landed in ZZZ and after the debrief with O'Hare ATC; we explained our situation. They had indicated to us that our position was not visible to them and the ground radar at that location was not always accurate. After our event; several other pilots voiced concern to Tower about the conditions and that is when they directed the plows to that area of the airport. This was conveyed to us by ATC directly when we called after we landed in ZZZ.  While I understand it is a new runway; there should be hold short lines depicted at every intersection accurately in our charts; including the low-vis charts. I have attached the most updated AMM screenshot of that taxiway intersection for [Runway] 9R.Weather was the main factor compounded by the errors in the Jeppesen charts.Having the CDF located on the west side of the airport with a west flow; plowing should take place before aircraft start movement on taxi routes to the departure runways. Also; Jeppesen needs to correct their charts.
Aircraft,My first officer and I were in the cruise segment of our flight at FL360 southbound from ZZZ heading towards ZZZ1 when we received the indication/annunciator that the right thrust reverser had unlocked and the light indication illuminated. I immediately began to slow the aircraft and asked the First Officer to get us a lower altitude. We were handed off to ZZZ1 Center who assigned us FL240. I used the air brakes to help slow us while maintaining a good rate of decent. Both thrust levers at idle. I instructed the FO (First Officer) to run the unlocked TR (Thrust Reverser) in flight checklist. ATC advised us that ZZZ2 was approximately 50 miles away from our position and we asked for vectors there. The checklist instructed us to shut down the affected engine. I delayed doing this until we were lower. In hindsight I don't think it would have made any difference to just shut it down at the time of reading. The TR never deployed and the light began intermittently going on and off. Around 18;000 feet we shut down the right side or Number 2 engine as per the checklist. Advised ATC of fuel and SOB (Souls on Board) and they asked if we needed emergency services. I can't remember if we asked for it or not but they were waiting for us when we landed. We discussed and agreed that we would land Flaps 25 and upon touchdown my FO would select Flaps 45 upon touchdown to insure we could use Lift Dump/aerodynamic breaking; we were single engine with a 20 plus knot gusting crosswind being that we had a great deal of runway we agreed that this was the best configuration for our aircraft. The conditions were less than ideal but I wanted to get the aircraft on the ground as soon as possible and as safely as we could. In hindsight; if I were to change any of my action the only other thing I would have done differently is check the winds at the destination; next time to make sure they are at least down the runway. I felt it was urgent to get down as quickly as possible in case the actual reverser were to deploy.
Human Factors,F/A (Flight Attendant) reported inoperative reading light en route to ZZZ. ACARS message sent en route for MX assistance upon arrival. Company Mechanic evaluated and determined problem was not light but light switch and communicated need for deferral. Mechanic departed with logbook and subsequently returned with logbook indicating deferral and placed white sticker in appropriate place. Dispatch sent ACARS message to have Captain call for obligatory conference call with MX Control regarding deferral of this inconsequential writeup. During this effort; ZZZ Supervisor verbally asked if we were aware HAZMAT in the form or radioactive pharmaceuticals were being loaded. With F/O (First Officer) attentive to this conversation; I (Captain) confirmed with Supervisor that a HAZMAT declaration would be brought for my signature.As both the F/O and I were busy preparing the flight deck for the next leg; and simultaneously attempting to eat our dinners; I called Dispatch for the required conference call. While the Dispatcher was aware of the MEL number (25-XX-XX); his system did not reflect the nature of the deferral. This MEL covers a myriad of non-essential cabin items. As a result; I had to read the actual discrepancy to the Dispatcher for him to be informed about the issue. The conference call (as usual) was neither informative nor helpful. It was purely a requirement that fulfilled (in this case) no need.After the conference call; the Dispatcher; upon my request; patched in a Chief Pilot on Call to discuss the need for relief of this requirement and how it only creates an additive condition with no benefit to the Flight Crew (only an additional administrative requirement). Upon completion of this discussion; the takeoff data came through ACARS; and we proceeded to complete checklists and review performance data. Takeoff and climb out were uneventful; and en route Dispatch sent an ACARS indicating I had failed to sign the required HAZMAT declaration.
Aircraft,Was on approach into ZZZ at about midnight after about an hour delay getting out of ZZZ1. The approach had been through layers of icing and precipitation ranging from light to heavy. We were given a heading to intercept and cleared ILS [Runway] XXL at 2;500 feet. ATIS winds were 110/10. The CA (Captain) configured as normal and spun the speed back to target of 150 kts. (145 + 5). We were in heavy winds and rain at this point with no forward visibility. Tower reported winds at ~20020G35. The jet was now fully configured; all anti ice on; on glide slope and the automation was attempting to keep the speed at 150. I was just saying how we needed to add 10 knots when the jet bounced and the stick shaker went off. I did not note the speed but the CA pushed the throttles up and I spun the speed to 160. No upset call was made but the quick throttle advancement corrected the speed. It was about this time that the CA said he no longer had an ILS and his FD (Flight Director) was gone. I still had one at the time but it then went out. He announced a Go-Around and we climbed up to 5;000 feet. The automation was reestablished and we talked about the winds and divert. We figured we had 16 minutes before heading to ZZZ2. ZZZ decided to change runways to XYR and we were given short vectors back around. We agreed we were ready and made the approach. On the approach the same thing happened where the CA FD dropped and the jet went into CWS (Control Wheel Steering) at about 2;000 feet. Mine was still available and the CA transferred the aircraft to me. About that time mine was lost as well. The visibility was better on the XYR approach despite the heavy rain and winds. We could make out the runway so the CA took back the jet and made the approach visually. During the visual I recycled the FD which eventually brought back the FD and ILS before touchdown.
Human Factors,Due to wake turbulence from a preceding aircraft and prevailing winds we elected to offset two miles to the left of track to keep us clear of the moderate turbulence. I had forgotten that SLOPing left of course is not authorized per the FOM. Sometime later; while I was on break; Gander Oceanic queried us as to why we were showing left of course and the Relief Pilot and First Officer corrected the error and returned to the center of the track. (SLOPing right of course would've put us back into the wake turbulence.)
Aircraft,Taxied out to Runway XX at ZZZ as planned and briefed. Nearing departure end we got an Eng 2 Reverser fault. Stopped and reviewed QRC. Nothing for on ground event noted. Called Maintenance Control. Decided to taxi back to ramp to clear taxiway and work issue. Taxied via Runway XX and exited at Taxiway XX. Parked on south side of Deice Ramp. Maintenance Control directed to start APU. Captain set brakes and we started APU. Upon direction from Maintenance Control; we shut down both motors. Captain stood up to check circuit breaker panel. CB at N41 on 121 VU panel was popped; labeled Engine 2 Oil Quantity Sensor Channel B.Upon Maintenance Control direction; we reset circuit breaker. We were directed to restart engines and report back. Started Engine 1. At 50% N2 the FO (First Officer) started Engine 2. Normal indications; when radio call reported engine fire on right side. FO looked right and saw some smoke blowing past the right window. Then the fire alarm and ECAM illuminated. FO looked up to verify indication and pointed to ECAM screen. Started to read the first step and alarm stopped and ECAM went away. Radio call reported sparks from bottom of Engine 2. There was a momentary alarm bell again and then it went away. Fire loop fault appeared and FO shut down motor with Master Engine switch. No other indications of fire noted. Airport CTAF called fire department. Crew stayed on phone with Maintenance and fire department reported a burn-through on the cowling and scorching on the cowling. Crew elected to taxi to Parking with fire department concurrence. Shutdown went normal. Passengers deplaned via air stairs. Normal checklists completed.
Procedure,We had to do a go-around at MMMX Runway 5R from about 500 AGL. The preceding airplane missed a turn-off. The go-around and missed were flown manually and without event. Once the airplane was turned away from terrain we reset automation; ran checklists; etc.I bring this up because the Tower issued us an immediate 30-degree right turn. This aims the airplane toward rapidly rising terrain and takes it off the missed approach course. Radios are saturated at MMMX and there are language considerations. This worked out fine. There's potential for a crew to be confused; aimed at terrain; and low. Maybe include this in videos or other products? Since we're opening an Aircraft X base; it's conceivable that Aircraft X crews will see MMMX with more regularity. Of course; there's an argument to do nothing too. Are any of these factors different from any other missed approach briefing anywhere else? My job isn't to make those decisions; but to bring these factors up to the attention of appropriate parties.
Aircraft,After landing and clearing the runway; Flight Attendants in the aft cabin called up to state there was a strong smell of a chemical similar to bleach; that their eyes were burning and they had put on their portable O2 masks. After a very short conversation with the Captain we agreed we would tell ZZZ ground we needed to go to a gate now; and to roll [support] vehicles. At the same time; I notified Operations of our situation. we completed associated procedures; (quick action; QRH etc). Upon gate arrival; the Fire Department stated they found volatile organic compounds in the [passenger cabin] air but that they were dissipating. Once off the airplane; we gathered as a crew and followed the fume event form on the Ipad. Then we went on to operate our next flight.[Reported stated cause] had to be either an aircraft maintenance issue or something that was spilled in the passenger compartment or possibly the cargo compartment.Since I don't know the exact cause; its difficult to have prevention suggestions.
Aircraft,During pre-flight in heavy snow and wind; the APU generator dropped off line; and became available again within about 10 seconds. This happened twice; about ten minutes apart. Also; the APU bleed air pressure dropped to lower than usual; then recovered about 30 seconds later. We advised maintenance; the mechanics checked our plane (737 MAX) and the 737 MAX on another gate; and informed us that the APU does that in heavy snow; likely due to snow entering the inlet door. The APU was operating normally. We planned to start one engine at gate (to keep ground power available; just in case APU dropped offline; similar to starting without an APU).  Flight eventually cancelled due to weather; we did not ever start an engine or leave the gate. If this is a known issue to the local mechanics; it should be in our manuals; or the problem should be addressed in some way. The APU is operating normally; but if the power can drop offline due to snow; that could be very problematic during pushback and engine start in snowy conditions; and potentially a safety issue if the aircraft is effectively stranded after pushback with only battery power in snowy conditions.  Our plan to start one engine at the gate with ground power available would be a proposed workaround; but that should probably be codified somewhere. Filing to indicate a potential safety issue.
Aircraft,Upon reaching cruise altitude of FL 340; we noticed a growing fuel imbalance between the main fuel tanks (no fuel in the center tank). As the left main tank quantity was decreasing more rapidly than the right; I had the FO (First Officer) go to the cabin for a visual inspection of the area around the left engine. He returned to the flight deck and reported nothing unusual. All other flight deck switches and indications were normal.Given the rate of the growing imbalance; approaching 700 lbs less in the left versus right tank; we decided to commence the Fuel Imbalance QRH checklist. As the checklist would direct a shutdown of the #1 engine; we requested priority handling with Center and began a diversion to ZZZ. We completed the checklist as we descended; accomplished a single-engine landing; and proceeded to the gate otherwise uneventfully.
Procedure,Flight took off at XA32Z and was on departure from Miami International airport; with the First Officer (FO) flying and the Captain (CA) operating as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The flight was given a 090 heading on departure until 2000 ft. when Departure Control (Frequency 119.45) directed a vector to the North and cleared the flight to climb to 7;000 ft. At XA35Z; the flight was level at 7;000 ft. in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) and Departure Control ordered 'Turn right to 090'. Read back the radio call and began an immediate right turn. While turning; Departure advised there was another aircraft somewhere at 11 o'clock and 1000 ft. below Aircraft X (which was unseen because of IMC). Immediately after making the traffic call; at XA36Z; Departure Control ordered an 'Immediate Left turn to 070'. Aircraft X rolled from a right hand turn into a left hand turn and attempted to comply; while the CA read back the instructions. While attempting to comply; just as the turn was reversing; Aircraft X was approximately over the KR66U fix and received a RESOLUTION ADVISORY (RA) that stated 'DESCEND!; DESCEND!'. The FO expeditiously put the aircraft in the RA window on the display; and correctly executed the RA maneuvers. The CA broadcast our RA compliance on frequency 119.45 and the TCAS indicated a contact immediately off our nose at our exact altitude. As Aircraft X descended through 6;850 ft. (shortly after the RA maneuver began); the TCAS aural alert 'Clear of contact' announced. The CA then transmitted to Miami's Departure in Frequency 119.45 that we were clear of contact and able to return to the 7;000 ft. and 070 heading as ordered. At this time; Departure cleared Aircraft X to climb and gave another course correction to a 090 heading. The flight continued without further incident. ATC vectored us into a near miss with another aircraft. Review routing/congestion issues in Miami Departure Control.
Aircraft,While in cruise flight at FL390; we experienced an uncommanded altitude climb. The auto pilot was engaged at the time. There was no master caution or warning alert. The aircraft felt as if it were kicked and pitched up abruptly. I immediately disconnected the autopilot stating my aircraft. A review of the ECAM revealed ELAC 2 fault. My First Officer had indicated when he arrived to the flight that he was relatively new to the Airbus. I elected in this regard to have him do the ECAM procedure rather than attempt to hand fly at FL390. The flow indicated reset but had the words ON THE GROUND ONLY. No reset was attempted. We notified Dispatch via ACARS and the station upon landing that there was a write up in the book. Dispatch replied with a question of if it were one or both ELACs. The flight attendants all said they felt the kick I mentioned earlier in this report. They also indicated that several passengers expressed concerns. The auto pilot was re engaged and the aircraft was flown into ZZZ without further incident. This was a case of a system malfunction thus no causal factors that I can think of exists.
Aircraft,During cruise at FL320 we got a brief Avionics Smoke indication that lasted approximately 3-5 seconds and extinguished. Following that indication approximately 2 minutes later the indication occurred a second time and remained indicated. We complied with the ECAM and QRH. Despite no visible smoke or smell we treated the indication as a valid indication and donned O2 masks and requested priority handling. We proceeded to ZZZ and landed on RWY XY. Fire trucks found no fire indication and we proceeded to taxi into [the gate]. Maintenance indicated after block in that the aircraft had suffered water intrusion days earlier and that they believed something in the avionics bay possibly shorted out causing the Avionics Smoke indication.
Aircraft,During push back the APU AUTO SHUTDOWN. Attempted a restart from the APU Panel. During attempted restart push back crew reported an APU FIRE. No indications in the cockpit. Complied with PHASE 1 and fired the #1 fire bottle. Ground crew reported fire extinguished. Complied with the rest of the QRH procedure and was tugged back into the gate.
Airport,Very short taxi to [Runway] 8L in Ontario so we had discussed and ran before takeoff checklist down to the line before leaving ramp. As we approached 8L I had called Tower and let them know we were ready for departure. If I remember they briefly told us to hold short awaiting IFR clearance and then it was just a couple seconds later she cleared us for takeoff on Runway 8L. The Captain was taxiing the aircraft into position as I was running the before takeoff checklist. As the airplane was just getting aligned with centerline the Captain mentioned he thought there was something on the runway. I was actually looking towards the far end of the runway to see if I could see any type of strobes or lighting as it was night time. It was once we had all the aircraft lights on that we could clearly see a van parked broadsided right on the middle of the runway about 1;000 feet in front of us or so. I had not yet called before takeoff checklist complete or verbally mentioned Runway 8L verified before the Captain had noticed something on the runway. No takeoff power was added or anything like that. I called the Tower to let them know there was a vehicle on the runway and the controller seemed very surprised. The controller cancelled our takeoff clearance and gave us a clearance to line up and wait. Controller then began communicating with FAA ground vehicles to try and get a hold of whomever was on the runway. Controller was unable to contact vehicle on the runway but was able to get a nearby airborne helicopter to hover over the vehicle and use a spotlight and or loud speaker to alert the personnel on the ground. We saw the ground personnel then run over to the vehicle; hop in; and drive off. The tower controller then had another FAA vehicle do a runway inspection the length of the runway and verify that everything was clear of the runway. Once the runway was verified to be clear we were once again cleared for takeoff. We ran the before takeoff checklist below the line again as it had been several minutes since our initial takeoff clearance. We departed ONT without further incident. The controller was very apologetic about the issue. Not sure exactly what happened or where the breakdown was that allowed the vehicle onto the runway without the controller's knowledge. It would have been very very difficult for controller to see the vehicle on the runway from the tower.Some type of breakdown in communication between FAA Ops vehicle/operator and Control Tower. The controller mentioned to us that the vehicle had not been authorized to be on the runway. I believe the operator had been out on the runway changing lights possibly? I do know the vehicle was running though and there was not anybody in the vehicle. Not exactly sure how/why vehicle had gotten out onto the active runway without authorization. Better communication/procedures between Ground Ops/Tower. I also think that if you're going to have vehicles like that on the runway; especially at night; they should be required to have some sort of strobe or beacon light. The vehicle was honestly very hard to see before all of our aircraft lights were on. If the vehicle had been further down the runway; I'm not sure we would have noticed it before we began the takeoff roll.
Weather,XA:30 engine start. Taxi instructions [Taxiway] XX; cross Runway XX; left on [Taxiway] XY. I performed a brake check while taxiing on [Taxiway] XX. Brakes were good. Crossed runway and turned left on [Taxiway] XY. Advanced power to accelerate a bit in order to do another brake check on Taxiway XY. I applied the brakes and could feel pressure; but had poor braking action which was very alarming because we just had good action not 5 minutes beforehand. I was left literally speechless...at that point I realized I had left the power up and immediately brought power to idle; released brakes fully and then rapidly applied brakes; to good effect....and then the brakes gave way again to poor braking action. By this time the bend in the taxiway was approaching; I released brakes and reapplied brakes; again to good effect initially; and then nothing....I brought the tiller around to try and make the turn; no effect; Immediately centered the tiller; rev thrust; and accepted the 'off'. I was able to steer with the tiller and gently brought the plane back up onto the taxiway fully. Set the parking brake. Called for help. Towed back to the line.Rapidly deteriorating conditions at the airfield due to a sudden drop in temperatures coupled with freezing precipitation. Taxiways were only chemically treated and the sand truck had not been down Taxiway XY yet; I did not know this at the time we were taxiing. Obviously I was taxiing too fast for conditions.Obviously a slower taxi speed was warranted. Conditions were deteriorating rapidly; I should have confirmed with Ground about the status of ground efforts to treat the runways and taxiways. Slowing down the tempo of operations would have also helped. My FO (First Officer)and I talked about everything that we were doing and we both felt comfortable as we were proceeding. It wasn't until we were on Taxiway XY that things went badly; and quickly.
Aircraft,Level at FL360; I heard a loud bang sound and felt a strong jolt in my feet. While looking to troubleshoot the issue; the Captain noticed my right side window was shattering. I looked over in time to see the cracking continuing. The Captain directed me to the Window Shattered QRH. I pulled the paper CRJ 700 QRH from the center console location and proceeded to follow it. On examination of of the window; we noted a new cold airflow from the right forward upper portion of the shattered window and cabin rate increasing. We could not achieve the required PSID (Per Square Inches Differential) in our initial or subsequent descent before the Cabin ALT caution and subsequent warning sounded. The Captain directed we don oxygen masks and [advised ATC] due to ATC not wanting us to descend further. At a lower altitude; around 10;000 feet; I switched to the QRH Manual Pressurization Control Procedure to attempt to regain control of cabin pressurization. At this point pressurization was stable and we coordinated removing our oxygen masks. The Captain checked with our flight attendants for any injuries or medical needs; of which there were none. He advised Dispatch of our diversion to ZZZ. We reviewed our steps; continued the QRH and descended to 8;000 feet. The subsequent approach; landing; and gate parking were uneventful.
Procedure,I along with Name were tasked to tow Aircraft X from Gate X to the hangar with the Supertug. ZZZ FAA Ground Controller clear us from the hangar via Taxiway 1 ALPHA cross RWY XX-XY on to BRAVO and hold short of MIKE taxiway. There Name contacted Company ramp control for clearance to Gate X. Company Ramp Control then cleared us from are holding position on taxiway BRAVO to Gate X. Supertug 1 started to proceed Name (radio / safety) told me to stop as a regional jet was passing in front of us on taxiway MIKE (left to right). I was blinded by the large flood lights set up in in the cart corral this impaired my line sign sight of a passing AC on taxiway MIKE. Company Ramp control did warn Supertug 1 of the passing regional jet.Lack of Company Ramp Control knowing position of aircraft on taxiways. Flood lights causing vision issues at that taxiway intersection.Return taxiways MIKE and BRAVO to FAA controlled area
Human Factors,On Date at approximately XA:50 while working a trip as the First Officer and Pilot Monitoring from ZZZ to HPN; The Captain had an unstable approach going full deflection on the glide slope. During the approach into HPN; we were in IMC conditions. We were given the ILS 16. ATC vectored us onto the approach where the Captain armed the approach for an ILS 16. Continuing inbound the auto pilot did not capture the approach at that time. The Captain noticed the ILS was not captured; the LOC nor Glide Slope. I asked The Captain if we should perform a go around; he told me no. He tried to correct it by pressing V/S and manually putting our required descent rate in. This did not seem to work so the Captain discontinued the autopilot. The Captain proceeded to disconnect the autopilot in order to hand fly the aircraft to get it re-established on the approach. As he continued we ended up going full deflection on the glide slope. At approximately 750ft MSL and 2NM from 16 runways threshold. Tower advised we were not on the LOC and asked us if we had the correct altimeter in; which we did. Ceilings were at 400ft and visibility was around 1600ft. The tower advised we were low and we needed to go around. I advised the tower we were going around. As we initiated the go around we got a GPWS warning. We were given an assigned heading and altitude during the go around. The Captain may have exceeded airspeed limits in the D airspace going approximately 250knots before slowing. We performed the go around safely and completed checklists. We were able to get vectored back around to shoot the approach again. We loaded the ILS 16 and shot the approach for the second time. We loaded the approach which then activated properly following the localizer and glide slope. We were able to get out of IMC conditions before minimums and had sight of the Runway. The Captain disconnected the autopilot and landed the aircraft safely at HPN.
Aircraft,When the Captain advanced the throttle levers prior to the Before Takeoff Checklist; the takeoff warning horn sounded and the associated warning light illuminated. We stopped the aircraft and began looking for any configuration error that could be causing the light to go off. We looked all over the flight deck; including the overhead panel; and could find nothing out of place or anything that would trigger this horn and light. It was a flaps 1 takeoff and they were at 1 and showed 1. The trim was properly set at between 5 and 6 to my recollection. The speed brake was down and stowed; and we checked it; jiggled it; it was definitely where it was supposed to be. All the door lights were out as well as the PSEU (Proximity Switch Electronics Unit) light.I had flown the airplane once that day and had no issues at all; so we put the flaps back up; waited a beat; and then reset the flaps to 1. The Captain then performed another throttle burst. We could not get the warning horn or the light to go off this time. We re-checked the configuration and probably did two handfuls of throttle bursts to make sure; and we could not get the issue to repeat itself. The airplane appeared fine. We continued our taxi and received our lineup and wait clearance and eventual take off clearance. It was the Captain's takeoff and the takeoff roll was normal. V1 was 132 knots. At 125 knots I was opening my mouth to call V1 as the aircraft continued accelerating; and at that very instant; the warning horn and light went off. The Captain performed the RTO per the QRH. After completing this; we then pulled the brake cooling data from the performance system; and it said we could return to the gate and required 50 minutes of brake cooling. We gave all the information to Maintenance and called Dispatch and Maintenance Control.
Aircraft,Climbing through 16;000 feet at roughly 260 kts. and having departed from ZZZ1; our flight experienced a failure of the pitch trim system. The failure was annunciated by the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) as a 'PTRIM BACKUP INOP' message and the pitch trim angle indication on the lower right side of the EICAS disappeared along with the numerical indicator. The autopilot simultaneously disengaged with the presentation of the above indications. As the Pilot in Command/Pilot Monitoring; I communicated our situation to ATC while the First Officer/Pilot Flying maintained control of the aircraft and continued to climb at approximately 260 KTS.I then executed the appropriate Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and appropriately executed the pitch trim inoperative procedure. We elected to level at 24;000 ft. and maintained between 250-260 KTS to minimize the control forces in cruise. [Priority handling was requested] with ATC due to the increased control forces that would be present when landing the aircraft. The decision was made to continue to ZZZ2 because of the length of the runways and the immediate presence of emergency support equipment and personnel at this field. A gradual descent and vectors were requested from ATC for the Runway XX Center ILS at ZZZ2. Company Dispatch was informed by ACARS of our situation & the Flight Attendant was briefed equally and told to expect a normal landing. A flaps 22 landing was executed at an approach speed of 160 KTS. to attempt to reduce the diving tendency of the aircraft at low speed without pitch trim control. The excess airspeed was bled off at 200 feet by retarding the throttles to idle and flattening the approach angle. Control forces in the flare were significant and estimated to have been approaching 100 LBS of force. Despite this; rate of descent at touchdown was approximately 100 FPM. A normal landing roll and taxi to the gate were then executed.Crew resource management was a critical factor in the safe completion of the flight. It may be advisable to introduce a stuck pitch trim scenario into recurrent training. Control forces present in the yoke are significant at low air speeds if the pitch trim is set for cruise or climb air speeds. Crew coordination is critical to ensure a safe approach and landing.
Aircraft,At 3k feet Captain smells slight odor while on base leg for landing. Upon landing and after clearing  the runway aft fight attendant notified Captain of strong odor on approach and rollout but was dissipating once off the runway. Performed Smoke and Fumes checklist and taxied to the gate. Requested [airport support personnel] escort to our gate as a precaution and performed necessary checklist and paperwork. Fire and rescue detected traces of a strong volatile/organic odor with their equipment in the aft cabin. APU was MEL and flight crew made absolutely no attempts to start it.[Captain suggested an] increase preventative maintenance and repairs on fleet while moving towards decreasing reliance on MELs.
Procedure,During preflight we received our weight and balance info from Dispatch via ACARS. We noted that something didn't seem right with the fuel breakdown. We had 111.9 lbs of total fuel but the fuel breakdown showed 5;600 in the left and right tanks with 0 in the center. When we called the Dispatcher to ask; he agreed that the fuel breakdown should have read 56;000 - 0 - 56;000. That is a 100;000 lbs error that could have easily caused an accident had our departure been at XA00; or if it had occurred in the middle of one of the many fatiguing sequences that we fly; and we missed the error. The correct weight and balance changed the takeoff CG by 4 units. I'm unfamiliar with the exact process so I cannot say [cause].This isn't the first time in recent history that this has happened. I'm not sure if something in the process of generating the weight and balance has recently changed or if everyone in the company is starting to get as fatigued and worn down as the pilots are. I'd suggest that the powers that be take a step back and rethink the process. Maybe add a step that addresses this problem specifically. Also; make the crews more aware that this is happening. Maybe add a line in the weight and balance that includes total fuel. In our case; a total fuel of 11;200 lbs is blatantly erroneous and another step in alerting the crew to the error.
Aircraft,On climb out; hydraulic green system low quantity. Complied with ECAM and QRH and secured green system hydraulic pumps. [Requested priority handling]. During cruise; green quantity continued to decrease to zero. Completed follow-on procedures for L/G gravity extension. Uneventful landing ZZZ Runway XXR. Gear pinned on runway and towed to gate. Emergency ground crew observed hydraulic fluid on right wing and right main landing gear upon shutdown on runway.
Aircraft,Nothing abnormal or anything out of the ordinary until calling for 'Gear down; landing checklist.' As soon as the First Officer finished his flow; he points to the landing gear indications and states that the right main gear isn't indicating locked; and still showing unsafe with the gear doors also open. He suggests a missed approach. I agree and we tell ZZZ Approach that we need to execute a missed approach for a landing gear unsafe indication. I was hand flying at the time; and starting down on glide path just under 4;000 feet MSL. Approach tells us to fly present heading and climb to 4;000 feet. I add power to climb; the First Officer sets the flight guidance; we take note of maintaining 215 or less; and the airspeed stays just under 200 knots. As we get vectored to downwind I [request priority handling] with ATC and we begin to run the alternate gear extension checklist. XX souls; about 1:20 minutes of fuel on board. Through conversation earlier on the trip; we had talked coincidentally about how long the alternate gear extension checklist takes; and to not dilly dally. I call the flight attendants and ask about what they can see with the landing gear; they say that they see them as both down and looking like they are in position. I make a PA to the passengers that we have a landing gear indicator light that isn't showing correctly and that we are going to run checklists to fix it. The First Officer ended up getting out of his seat to pump the main gear as the light didn't illuminate; and the alternate indications in the floor also showed that the right main was not secure. The alternate gear extension checklist did not fix the problem; as the First Officer moved onto the alternate gear extension failure checklist; I get on SATCOM and contact Maintenance Control. They tell us to run the associated checklists and ask our intentions; and then transfer us to Dispatch. We relay the events and what we had done; and I state my intentions again; to run the checklists as much as possible; then return to landing before we run out of gas no matter the outcome.At this point; ATC has us holding north of ZZZ1 at the ZZZZZ fix. There's a 50 knot wind out of the south; and I take note as to when we need to head towards the field to have fuel to land with. The alternate extension failure checklist does not produce results. We review gear unsafe landing checklist; then proceed to re-run the alternate gear extension checklist as driven by the failure checklist. No result. At this point we have about 1;800 pounds of fuel remaining; are north of ZZZ1 with a headwind; and I determine it's time to make for the airport. I call the flight attendants and advise them that we will be shutting down the #2 engine; and give them the [preparation] report for cabin prep; and brief our bracing signal of emergency lights on and brace brace brace over the PA when we get to about 500 feet. I then make a PA to the passengers about shutting down the engines and precautions of trucks on the runway; to follow Flight Attendant instructions; and thank them for their compliance. We review the gear unsafe landing checklist again; then go to the [specific] checklist to shut down the #2 engine in the event that the gear does collapse on landing. We shut down the engine; run the engine clean up items checklist; brief Runway XXL ILS; landing flaps 35 planning to land on the left side of the runway..and we proceed inbound. We configure early; the conditions were nice for a single engine approach; wind about 10 knots no ice; no turbulence; at 500 AFE turn on the emergency lights and give the brace signal over the PA and land. Come to a stop on the runway; and run the checklist to shut down the number 1 [engine]. We talk with Tower and Airport Ops about staying on the runway; and I try to figure out what's next. We have a tow team coming; but I ask about getting buses. Remembering the gear gets pinned during a tow; I feel confident about leaving passengers on board during the tow. I make a PA to the passengers about remaining in their seats and thanking them for their compliance. I step out of the plane to go talk with the tow team and notice that the gear doors are still open from the alternate gear extension checklist. I call Maintenance Control and they say to start an engine to energize the hydraulics to shut the door. I coordinate with the tow team and Airport Ops about starting the engine; then we will be towed to the gate. Getting back to the flight deck we secured all the doors; ran the originating and before start checklists. We attempted to start #1 and got no light off. Ran the engine start abort checklist. Tried to start #2; no light off. Ran abort checklist. I wasn't having a good day at this point; and when I had called Maintenance Control had noticed a text from Name; so I called Name for some grounding and guidance. As I said hello; I noticed both T handles were still pulled. I laughed to myself; and put them back in. We started the number 1 with no issue; energized the hydraulic systems; shut down the #1 and got towed to the gate. I had made announcements to the passengers before and during this process. At the gate; we deplaned normally. A Flight Attendant Supervisor was waiting; and talked with the flight attendants and removed them from flying for the rest of their day. Crew Scheduling tried to assign a ZZZ2 turn to the First Officer and he said he was fatigued. (I don't think they knew what just happened) then I got our crew together and debriefed a little bit. Talked about what we experienced; how we felt; and that we were all done for the day. Afterwords; I called Name again and told him the story that I'm writing now; and we talked about some of the choices and decisions that our crew had made. I felt like my First Officer; flight attendants and passengers had all done a remarkable job with the situation dealt to us. The mechanic who met us at the airplane had stated that the plane had recently undergone some extensive landing gear work; so maybe that was a part of the faulty indications. I'm grateful the gear worked as desired and I feel that shutting down the engine gave me a lot of confidence proceeding to the landing.  Same as aboveNext time I would restart all flows and reconfigure the airplane to a starting position after setting everything up for the engine start. The T handle situation I wish I had noticed; but I was parked on [Runway] XXL; had just had a rather stressful event; and we caught it eventually.I think a Sim Instructor would have done a good job resetting the plane; but it was my first time pulling T handles in the actual plane. I was very impressed how well the plane flew single engine; it really was a low stress aspect to the event. I also felt that choosing to shut down the engine mitigated a very large threat and danger to the passengers; so I stand by that decision.
Weather,On the 4th leg of the day and short overnight due to getting in 2 hrs late the night before. Leaving ZZZ1 to ZZZ; the weather was clear and planning for a Visual; but backing it up with an approach per the company night visual policy. We choose the RNAV XX due to wanting something other than the ILS and not having flown the RNAV XX other than in the simulator. Once airborne and talking to Center we got slowed to slowest possible speed due to a MedEvac ahead of us on an approach to ZZZ. The MedEvac canceled IFR and allowed us to get cleared for the RNAV XX. We briefed it up as a visual backed up by the RNAV so I did not brief the notes on the approach. Flying the approach when turning final; I notice the PAPI was showing 4 red and thought that odd. I prepared to disconnect Autopilot and climb to the Visual Glide Path; but wanted to see what the approach was doing. Due to being close to the airport and seeing the ridge prior to the airport; I did not want to look at the notes to see if there was a note about the VGSI not coincident. About 200 feet above minimums the GPWS gave a Terrain Terrain warning. I promptly disconnected the Autopilot and climbed to follow the VGSI. We landed safely and checked the altitude to see if our altimeter was set incorrectly. That checked within 10 feet. During the taxi to the ramp; I noticed the cold weather temp comp was required for temps less than -7 deg. When stated; the Captain said something like that should't be the factor; then he looked at the DATA card which was on his yoke; and noticed that the temp was -13 degrees. Captain commented that the cold temp would probably account for the couple hundred feet low on the approach. Lessons learned brief notes when we probably will be flying an approach that ATC clears us for. Try to incorporate Temp Comp which is currently not allowed with any FMS approach even for visual approaches.
Aircraft,On Date on the RNAV XX for ZZZ when flaps 45 were selected we received a FLAPS FAIL EICAS message. Flaps indicated they had stuck at 37 degrees. Numbers had been ran for both 22 and 45 previously with flaps 45 planned. We chose to continue the approach and added +5kts to our Ref speed. Landing was normal without an issue. Flaps did not retract once on the ground.
Aircraft,Auto Trim Fail to Autopilot Failure on climb out.
Aircraft,On Aircraft X on Date it presented like a normal operation day. Myself and my crew had done all of our preflight duties; secured the cabin; performed the safety demo; and sitting in the jump seat for take-off. During climb out of ZZZ just above 10 thousand feet and doing the service announcements; Captain called with normal 2 high low chimes to notify us that we were having an incident and that something was wrong with our pressurization and we would be returning to ZZZ. I asked 'Do we need to run the checklist and prepare the cabin? He replied; 'No; it'll be fine' Not questioning him I informed my C FA (Flight Attendant) who is on their second day as a line flight attendant what was going on. We sat with no communication for quite a while at least 15-20 minutes. The Captain finally got on the PA and addressed the cabin to let the passengers what was going on. At this point I called the flight deck to inform them that the cabin was sweltering hot and asked if they could put the cool air on. I did wait to call them at first as the cabin temp is not an emergent item when they were dealing with pressurization issues and our decompression. When the air started it was like all the air was sucked out of the cabin and everyone's ears started popping really bad; I was concerned that I was going to have 2 blown ear drums. When this happened; I called the pilots and said; 'Turn the air off as whatever happened just made everyone in the cabins ears blow and felt like the air is being sucked from the cabin.' The Captain's reply was 'We will fix it soon.' I then heard my B FA call from the back with the emergency 4 chimes to the pilots and picked up as well so I could be informed of what was going on in the cabin as the A FA. She told the pilots that the aft doors were whistling really bad and was concerned that they might open all together. The Captain just said again 'we will fix it soon' We had no further communication from the pilots after her call. Upon landing in ZZZ; and disarming and opening the doors the Operations Agent came on saying 'So we are just going to fuel and go' I instantly turned and went into the flight deck and said what the Operations Agent had said and that it couldn't be true that we needed Maintenance. The Captain just said I needed to leave the flight deck and close the door because he needed to make some calls. The B FA then called me and asked if we were feeling okay because she was shaken and was throwing up from the decompression. The Operations Agent then said to me that this was 'pilot error' and everyone on the ground knew already that's why we were fueling and going. At this point I stepped off the plane on the jet bridge and called Operations to have me and my FAs pulled because we were too shaken to fly and that we were all having issues with our ears; feeling dizzy and nauseous but didn't need immediate assistance. The Captain came out of the flight deck with the Station Manager and made a jubilant announcement encouraging the cabin (passengers and crew) to be excited to go without even checking on his crew. I then informed him that we were being pulled and not continuing. I stood in the galley waiting for further instructions when I heard the Captain say to the effect of 'I [messed] up' and 'I'm out of get out of jail free cards'. After everyone got off the plane the Captain then tried to smooth talk us and act concerned. Come to find out on my report the pilots never [requested priority handling] to land. I am troubled this Captain acted so nonchalantly about this decompression incident. The fact that he did not treat this incident as an emergency situation and that a [request for priority] was not claimed; is extremely alarming. Had any of the crew's eardrums ruptured; it could be a career ending event. My perception is that he was simply minimizing the seriousness of this event to avoid discipline. What other emergencies go undocumented?
Airport,XX Gate in ZZZ needs to be redesigned or converted to a dedicated RJ Gate; due to shorter wingspan. On taxi in traffic on the access road would not stop to allow us to enter the alley. The ground traffic continued to pull up to the traditional stop bars. They had no way of knowing they needed to use the alternate ones adjacent to the Gate. Further at night that traffic blinds you with their headlights making it impossible to see the guide men. Lastly during push back traffic on the access road was driving around our aircraft. This put them dangerously close to our ground personnel and aircraft. Basically our wings were far over the road. Traffic approaching behind the aircraft merely side stepped and zipped past us. One vehicle drove past our guide person by less than 5? I was concerned that he was going to be hit. That road is unacceptably dangerous. Reserve that gate for smaller aircraft. Educate all people with driving access to not drive around aircraft while parking there.
Ambiguous,Upon check in with Approach; we were advised that we would fly the ILS 24R due of traffic. Loaded ILS 24R into the FMS; briefed the approach and discussed the taxi via standard taxi route back to the South complex. Upon landing; started the exit off of 24R at Taxiway AA and we were told to hold short of 24L; (visibility was 2 miles due to fog.)Quickly consulted the Airport Moving Map (AMM) chart to determine if this would lead to a taxi onto a parallel taxiway; like with the more familiar southern runways; or a direct crossing via an angle or a 90 degree turn. Upon looking up and trying to make sense of the visual; I saw the 24L hold short line but no signage. I was momentarily confused and thought the hold short line was the exiting hold short line for 24R. Upon realizing it was the hold short for 24L; I immediately stopped the aircraft; but the nose of the aircraft had crossed the hold short line by approximately 5 feet.I told the First Officer to radio Tower to tell them we stopped across the hold short line. They acknowledged our transmission; told us to hold our position; and then cleared us across the runway onto Taxiway AA to cross the field to the Southern complex. [Possible causes are] reduced visibility; lack of signage; [and] lack of recent experience with approaches to north runways at LAX. [Other possible causes are] unperceived bias and distraction during critical phase. [Possible solutions are to] stay heads up at critical points at airport; resist biases from previous experience at familiar airports; and to fully comprehend the anticipated taxi route you will receive. [Be aware of] expected vs assigned ATC clearance.
Human Factors,We were being vectored for a visual approach to Runway XX at ZZZ The weather was VMC with good visibility and winds were out of the west at approximately 15 knts. I was the Pilot Monitoring and the Captain (CA) was the Pilot Flying. The last vector required a bit of a tight turn to final. We were configured flaps 2; 170 kts. and the gear down turning to final; with the approach armed and all automation engaged. During the turn; the CA managed speed and we continued with the flap configuration. About halfway through the turn; I noticed the hook rising and the autothrust was slow to spool. We got the 'SPEED SPEED' aural alert. At this time; the CA disconnected the autopilot and we performed a soft go-around. I informed ATC that we were going around because we were going to be a little high. ATC provided us vectors for another approach. Since we were above 1000 ft. we elected to remain configured to for the vectors for another final. On the base turn; we were pretty close to ZZZZZ. The CA started a descent to 1500 ft. I stated that the altitude at ZZZ was 1900 ft. At about 1700 ft.; ATC stated that they had a low altitude alert. We started the climb back up and intercepted the glide path. At 1000 ft.; the CA decided the automation wasn't providing satisfactory performance so he disconnected the autopilot and autothrust and continued the approach by hand flying. All checklists were complete. I verified all paramaters were stable at 500 ft. and we continued the landing. I believe that the tight turn to final and shorter than normal vectors contributed to the low speed event. The event very likely would have been prevented by requesting a longer downwind/base turn on the final approach. Worthy of note; I was surprised at how slowly the autothrust was responding to the demand. In X years and 3;700 hours on the airplane; I hadn't experienced that much of a 'lag.' That said; I fully acknowledge that we didn't help ourselves in anyway accepting short vectors. There was certainly some startle factor as well. I should have been more assertive with the CA and ATC in requesting a longer final. We were a heavy; it was a little windy; and the traffic in the area was light at the time. In the past; I have asked for longer finals if I felt that the vectors were going to be tight for the aircraft performance and configuration. I'm honestly not sure why I didn't this time. I know better. Going forward; I will be much more assertive with the crew and ATC if I see potential for a similar scenario developing. I see no reason to ever accept a vector that close to the FAF.
MEL,"We failed to run MEL 27-XXX (X) procedures and flew the aircraft in an unsafe configuration due to ELAC 1 being left off. Background - we returned to the gate for a F/CTL ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT ECAM. Reset from QRH was unsuccessful. Maintenance was called and they performed action for MEL 27-XXX ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT; including securing circuit breakers in the flight deck and electronics bay and selecting the ELAC 1 push button to OFF. Following Maintenance; the ECAM displayed F/CTL ELAC 1 FAULT"" with ECAM actions of ""- ELAC 1...OFF THEN ON. IF UNSUCCESSFUL: - ELAC 1...OFF"" and ""C/B TRIPPED ON OVHD PNL TRIPPED R ELEC BAY."" At this point; I told Maintenance and the CA (Captain) that the F/CTL ELAC 1 FAULT ECAM was not expected and not noted in documentation for MEL 27-XXX. I also made them aware that this ECAM display was noted in MEL 27-XXY; ECAM FAULT.Maintenance was in the flight deck. The CA and Maintenance both said that was normal. MEL 27-XXX (Z) Procedures Step X states; ""At initial placarding and prior to each departure; deactivate ELAC 1 in accordance with AMM 27-93-00-040-001-A."" This note was used to belay my concerns that the ELAC 1 FAULT ECAM was OK. The ECAM was not performed and the CA used emergency cancel to clear all the ECAMs. Maintenance left and I then began to review the (X) procedures for MEL 27-XXX; and was stopped by the CA; who said there was no need to run the procedures because the ""F/CTL ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT alert"" was not displayed as discussed in (X) E.1 (DURING COCKPIT PREPARATION; prior to starting engines; if the F/CTL ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT alert is displayed...). I stated we still needed to run (X) E.2-5; but the CA told me (X) E.1.j; ""After 5 seconds do the following checks:"" proves that those steps were only done if Step Y was done; and Step Y is only done if you have the F/CTL ELAC 1 PITCH FAULT alert. I stated this was incorrect and we would be taking off without checking any of the SECs (Spoiler Elevator Computers) or that our flight control back-ups worked. I was assured that Dispatch and Maintenance both agreed that this was the proper interpretation of the MEL. Again; I expressed my concern about the ELAC 1 FAULT and that this was not in the MEL and was told sometimes I needed to just trust what people told me. We started engines and ran all the checklists; including the F/CTL checks; without any issue. We took off with ELAC 1 OFF; related ECAMs emergency cancelled; and without doing any (X) procedures for MEL 27-XXX. Climb; cruise; and descent were uneventful.Upon arrival into ZZZ1; we performed a visual backed up with the ILS to XXL. I was the pilot flying. I coupled A/P (Autopilot) 1 and 2 for the ILS. At approximately 1300 ft.; I disconnected A/P via the side stick switch. Only A/P 2 disconnected. This was due to the ELAC 1 being OFF. We were not aware this was a symptom of a secured ELAC 1. The CA took controls briefly to confirm his side stick A/P disconnect worked. Controls were given back to me just before 1000 ft. and I continued the approach and landing without the use of A/P 1 or 2. The landing was uneventful; other that the roll control in the flare not being smooth. I noted all this to the CA. At the gate; the CA wrote up the FO (First Officer) A/P switch and maintenance was performed to lubricate it. I reviewed SAFE and saw a follow-on flight wrote up the F/CTL ELAC 1 FAULT ECAM and Maintenance referred them back to MEL- 27-XXX.The (X) procedures were not performed for MEL 27-XXX. Step Z.1 has the flight crew returning to a normal configuration and turning the ELAC 1 P.B. SW ON. This would have prevented this safety issue. In addition; there are no notes in the MEL that alert flight crews they will see F/CTL ELAC 1 FAULT or the C/B-tripped ECAMs prior to performing the (X) procedures; as is the case in MEL 27-XXY. MEL 27-XXX (Z) Procedures Step X says to deactivate ELAC 1 and this led to the CA's assumption the ELAC 1 would be left OFF. I went along with the CA's suggestion Ishould trust Dispatch and Maintenance without MEL documentation to support it. The CA is a Check Airman; and although not an issue through the process; it was the last thing I told myself as we took the runway.(X) E.1 should clarify that if ""PITCH FAULT"" is displayed; do Step Y then 2-5; and if ""PITCH FAULT"" is not displayed; skip Step Y and do A-B. The MEL should include notes about F/CTL ELAC 1 FAULT and CB TRIPPED ECAMs."""
Aircraft,After landing in ZZZ; Aircraft X; while parked waiting for a gate; the aft FA (Flight Attendant) called the cockpit stating that during final descend around 6;000 ft. they smelled the dirty sock odor in the back of the airplane; the odor was present then went away during the final descent and the upon landing the odor came back and went away again. I told her that we were going to park; disembark and have Maintenance inspect the airplane. We parked shortly after and disembarked the passengers. I talked to the Flight Attendant number 1 and asked him about it and he told me that he went back and did not smell anything. I also asked him if the other [cabin] crew members were OK and he replied yes we all are OK. The odor was spontaneous and went away. I call Maintenance in ZZZ1 and reported the issue and made a log book entry. Maintenance ZZZ1 told me they will address the issue with maintenance in ZZZ.No further actions was required and all crew members went to the hotel and worked the next flight the next day without any complaints.
Aircraft,Upon applying APU bleed at gate; entire aircraft experienced a strong dirty socks odor. Pack isolation did not resolve issue. APU bleed off decreased intensity; but strong residual odor remained onboard. Crew deplaned shortly after bleed turned off.
Procedure,ZZZ1 to ZZZ; Aircraft X received maintenance at FBO. A major concern arose during pushback; the ramp is very congested with large business jets directly across FBO's hangar. While pushing back; I realized our left wing was well over an Aircraft Y. The Tug Driver responded it was OK; they had a Wing Walker. I insisted we stop the push and not place our wing over other aircraft. Ahead and to the left was Aircraft Z clearing US Customs. To avoid this we were pulled ahead and far to the right of the taxiway centerline; then the tug disconnected. I refused to taxi out until Aircraft Z was moved as it would have passed well under the bottom 1/3 of my side window. Eventually after nearly an hour a tug moved Aircraft Z and we departed for ZZZ. Suggestions - Move other aircraft as to not encroach the footprint of Aircraft A aircraft prior to push and start.
Aircraft,On climbout of ZZZ; approximately 10;000 feet; had an ECAM message ENG1 COMPRESSOR VANE. After following ECAM procedures the only instruction is to avoid rapid thrust movements. We continued our Climb and our route to ZZZ1. In order to avoid rapid thrust movements; I descended using VS instead of open descent. At approximately 28;000 feet on the arrival the engine made it to idle and I heard an audible bang from the number one engine followed by the ECAM message ENG1 STALL. After accomplishing the first step of the procedure; THR LEVER1....Confirm....IDLE; The engine failed and we got the ECAM message; ENG1 FAIL. We followed the procedure and decided not to restart due to engine damage. We continued into ZZZ1 single ENG and had an uneventful landing. We stopped on the runway to allow inspection of the aircraft. We were given the all clear and taxied to the gate uneventfully. Mechanical anomaly caused by a failure of either the low compressor bleed valve or the variable stator vane.
Aircraft,When we were on the takeoff phase; we got a Level 2 Tire Failure alert below 100 kt. and we rejected the takeoff and returned to the gate. When we arrived to the airplane it already had the Level 2 Tire Failure. The previous crew advised us that they also had a tire failure on landing. When we talked with the mechanics about the issue of the tire failure alert; they told us that they; Maintenance; do not know why that alert is coming up even though they deactivated the system. After that they tried to deactivate the whole system brake system and tire pressure monitoring so the Level 2 Tire Failure would not come up again. For that reason; I talked with the Captain and told him that I did not agree with that procedure since Maintenance do not know why that alert is coming up. [The problem was identified by the] Level 2 Tire Failure alert on takeoff. [It was caused by] improper MEL deferral procedure. [The flight crew responded to the problem and] the Captain rejected the takeoff and I put forward pressure on the yoke and applied full spoilers. [I suggest] better maintenance procedure and better communication between stations.
Procedure,During the takeoff roll in the low-speed region; we received am ECAM F/CTRL GRND SPLR fault 3+4. We assumed this was an ECAM associated with our current deferral F/CTL AIL SERVO fault and decided to continue rather than abort. When at a safe altitude; we reviewed the ECAM in detail and concluded that this was a separate issue and we should have aborted.
Aircraft,On approach to landing at ZZZ we received a slat fault indicating zero slats in flap position 1. ECAM and QRH were followed to plan for flap 3 slat 0 approach and landing to Runway XX at ZZZ. [Requested priority handling] with ATC. Airport and runway conditions were considered [and] landing distance was calculated. Dispatch was contacted along with a briefing with the Purser prior to conducting a successful approach and landing to Runway XX.
Aircraft,We were on a normal approach to Runway XXR in ZZZ. When we attempted to select flaps 25; the FLAPS TE DISAGREE EICAS illuminated and the flaps stayed at 20. We went around from approximately 1;000 ft. AGL and I ran the non-normal procedure while the FO (First Officer) flew the aircraft as were vectored back for a visual approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ. We completed the non-normal checklist; sent a quick ACARS message to Dispatch; talked briefly to the flight attendants to tell them we were landing very soon; and made a flaps 20 landing. Per ZZZ Maintenance; we left the flaps at 20 and wrote up the malfunction at the gate.
Human Factors,Undeclared Hazmat [cargo] discovered after takeoff. It was described to me as Miscellaneous; Category 9 in positions 1R (main deck) and A (lower forward). Ramp says no subcategories; no batteries. Ramp says no restrictions with loading it next to ADG or in the lower forward cargo. 483kg of Hazmat in each position. Crew notified of these details.
Weather,We landed at ORD on Runway 27C. Conditions were VFR; with 5's being reported as RCCs for 27C. Taxiways were slightly wet at time. We then were given taxi instructions consisting of 'E2 E M X4L G TT A'. Upon crossing 4L; Captain instructed First Officer to shut down engine 1. Upon making the turn from TT onto the A bridge; we started sliding to the left and almost off taxi; but stopped before then. Captain was taxiing slow given the wetness of Taxiways. However; we both did not realize that the bridge would be far more icy due to it being an overpass. We started engine one back up and continued taxi into gate uneventfully. Not anticipating the bridge being icy due to it being an overpass; which is always far colder. If we had realized that; we would have kept engine 1 running due to that possibility of ice contamination. Think ahead for the taxi and if in doubt of any portion of it being uncontaminated; do not taxi in single engine.
Aircraft,We were approximately 20 minutes from ZZZ when we received numerous status messages and a Hydraulic System 3 low pressure message. My FO (First Officer) retained the flight controls and took over the radios while I checked the QRC. Before proceeding to the QRH we scrolled through the electrical synoptic pages and discovered we had magenta GEN2; IDG2; AC BUS2; and lost TRU 2 and ESS TRU2 but had no warning or caution messages as to what the root failure was; only the associated status messages. We ran the QRH for Hydraulic System 3 and were able to regain pressure by turning on Pump 3B. Next; we discussed our thoughts about the electrical malfunction and came to the conclusion that the loss of GEN2/IDG2 was the root cause of the other malfunctions. I flipped through the QRH sections relating to GEN failures. However; we were both reluctant to reset the generator or start the APU without being specifically directed to do so by a warning/caution message that directed us to the correct QRH procedure. At this point I checked in with the flight attendants. Next; I tried to text Dispatch but we had also lost all ACARS functions on the FMS. We were able to contact them through ARINC. After that I called ZZZ Maintenance and asked if they thought it would be ok to start the APU to get another generator on line. They said they didn't see a problem with that.At this point we were approaching 10;000 ft. and after another short talk we both decided we didn't want to risk making the problem worse since we weren't 100% certain what the problem was and were also only about 10 minutes from being on the ground. We coordinated with ATC to leave some space behind us since we had both flaps and slats half-speed status messages and didn't want to be forced into doing 170 - 180 kt. to the FAF. They accommodated us and once safely on the ground we started the APU; which opened the bus ties that had closed and gave us back TRU2 and ESS TRU2. GEN1/IDG1 and AC BUS 2 remained magenta.I feel we handled the situation fairly well. My FO did a great job handling the aircraft and radios and allowed me to coordinate with the company / ATC. We did go back and forth for a while about the pros and cons of starting the APU but eventually decided the safest most conservative decision was to focus our efforts on landing the plane and not introduce the possibility of further electrical problems. Had we been further from ZZZ I think we would have started the APU to avoid prolonged flight on one generator.Maintenance determined it was a GCU (Generator Control Unit) failure. They were eventually able to reset it by shutting the plane down; unplugging / plugging back in the GCU; starting the engine; and then resetting GEN2. Maintenance also said there was no history of GCU failures and that they were confident it wouldn't happen again. We flew 2 more legs with no issue.
Human Factors,Cargo shipment containing UN3316 not registered on flight and no NOTOC issued - cargo loaded on Aircraft X.
Weather,Aircraft X; from ZZZ1 to ZZZ was a routine flight; the second sequence in our day.  I was the PM (Pilot Monitoring); and I accomplished the approach planning prior to TOD.  I recorded ATIS Z a special report issued at XA:09Z. Winds 180-12; 8SM vis; -FZRA overcast at 2900. 00/-3 A30.13 RCC 5-5-5 on [runway] XXL/R.We briefed the RNAV Z XXL.  On check-in with ZZZ Approach; we were told to expect ILS XXR and to pick up ATIS A. We programmed the FMC for XXR and I scanned over ATIS A; no significant changes in wind or visibility; but the temp had warmed above freezing and the -FZRA identifier had been removed; RCC (Runway Condition) was still 5-5-5 both runways. Approach then offered the RNAV XXL; we accepted the approach clearance and I programmed the FMC again while we were still IMC. I was busy with the aircraft in IMC; two approach changes; I didn't spend the time necessary to review the many taxiway closures; the list was extensive; possibly over 20 closures. I was satisfied that the weather conditions had improved; and or were similar to the calculations in ATIS Z. We broke out of IMC at 4;000 feet MSL; and flew a visual backed up by the RNAV data.  The aircraft touched down in the TDZ; and we slowed; I bypassed the high-speed turnoff and slowed to taxi speed as we continued down the runway.  We received no exit instructions from Tower; I slowed the aircraft to smoothly make the 90 degree turn at [taxiway] X.  Once established on [taxiway] X; the aircraft began to drift right.  Control inputs had zero affect. I had full left tiller and max left brake and the aircraft did not respond to my control inputs. Braking action was NILL. As the nose wheel approached the edge of the taxiway it regained traction and we corrected back left to the center line.  There was no obvious indication of damage to either the aircraft or airport lighting.We informed Tower and Ground Control of the NILL braking; and that there was a possibility taxiway lighting was damaged. The remainder of the taxi to Gate X was uneventful.  I inspected the aircraft and found no damage; called Dispatch to inform them of the taxiway conditions and to initiate a three-way call with the Chief Pilot to report the incident.  I made an aircraft logbook entry; and Contract Maintenance inspected the aircraft. Walking on the ramp was hazardous. There was a 1/8' layer of ice on all untreated surfaces.Additive Conditions:No instructions from Tower Controller on which taxiway to use to exit runway.Taxiway X was untreated.Changing ATIS during approach phase.No visual reference to the slippery surface conditions.[Taxiway] X closure NOTAM was issued while aircraft was on descent. Long list of closed taxiways not plotted on 10-9 due to aircraft being in IMC; on downwind leg; and PM being task saturated. Wind direction was consistent with the sliding direction of the aircraft.Expectation Bias:5-5-5 RCC was expected on taxiways as well as runway. The removal of -FZRA with temp above freezing from ATIS lowered my guard.I associate closed taxiways with illuminated warning lights or barriers.Lessons learned:When taxiway closures affect runway exit; I will make a note of possible exit points and look for those specifically on the ATIS; not hunt and plot on the 10-9 chart; and I will ask Tower where we are expected to exit the runway; not necessarily the first available exit as the AIM 4-3-20 directs.  When there is visible surface contamination; I creep up on all turns; I was going pretty slow; but maybe a slower speed would have prevented the incident. The removal of the -FZRA note on ATIS A lowered my guard; but it also prevented any Pilots that hadn't received ATIS Z from knowing that there was a possibility of surface contamination; and lower than 5 surface conditions. Now I am aware that the primary access points to/from a runway are the first and last taxiways.If our EFB Jepps App had the ability to automatically plot taxiway and runway closures from active NOTAMs; Situational Awareness and Safety would be increased.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Taxing into X at night. It was dark and the ramp area had moisture/ice present. Self-park system was active. There was evidently 2 lead -in lines to this gate; but I lined up on the wrong line to the right. Both the FO (First Officer) and myself; thought we had the correct lead-in line and never saw the other line (probably due to the glare from the terminal lights and the wet/icy ramp). I verbalized the aircraft type (737-700) and call sign were correctly displayed on the parking system; and began proceeding inbound to park. However; we were so far right of the actual lead-in line the display was not normal. When just a little right or left; chevrons are displayed showing the direction to turn. In this case however; it was  a very flattened chevron pattern and it looked odd. My first thought was this is a new system I am unfamiliar with. I suppose because we were lined up  on the line (confirmation bias) and because the ground handler watched without signaling or showing any concern; I proceeded inbound; thinking it would begin to display properly. I was also tired. The First Officer was watching the right wing and instructed me to stop which I did. Our right wing was close to the a jet bridge. We ended up shutting down the engines and requested to be towed in after realizing we were on the wrong line.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On final for the ILS 11; we noticed a cruise ship departing the dock to the left of final; heading towards the southeast. There is a note on the airport page for Aruba which states that 'ships transit the Runway 11 approach path. Tower coordination is required prior to a ship being permitted to transit'. Tower did not inform us of that the ship had permission to cross our path on final. Approximately 1000 feet on final I made the decision to go-around as a possible collision of our aircraft/gear with the ships 'whale tail' funnel was possible. As we executed the go-around; Tower did not understand the problem with the ship crossing final. When we fly our second approach; we estimated from the ships wake and position we may have cleared the ship by 100 feet.Tower was not concerned about the cruise ships paths crossing our final approach. I believe all approach need to be halted or reduced when a ship cross the final course. If there had been a cloud deck present; we would not have seen the ship until it was too late. This is an unnecessary risk for our flights.If the weather is less than 3000 and 5 miles; then Aruba needs to protect the final approach corridor and prevent any ships from crossing the final course to Runway 11.
Company Policy,When we arrived at ZZZ from ZZZ1; I learned that one of the flight attendants was feeling ill and that she strongly suspected that it was COVID. The flight attendants were very professional and the sick flight attendant had no incentive to lie about it. After all; being COVID positive would prevent her from going home. Also; if she is sick from COVID; then all of the flight attendants are likely exposed.We passed on the information that a flight attendant is sick and that the others are possibly exposed. The sick flight attendant went to take a COVID test and we understood that it should take only about 15 minutes. We considered this to be the quickest and safest option. If she tested negative; then we can go with a replacement flight attendant. But until then; the flight attendants did not consider themselves to be fit to fly; and I did not consider them to be fit to fly either. Also; adding a new flight attendant to an infected crew would only get the new flight attendant infected.The process of the flight attendant getting tested was taking much longer than I expected. The Flight Manager entered the cockpit and told me that I am holding up operations. Apparently; he wanted us to go with a replacement flight attendant without checking for exposure or even making sure that the aircraft was sanitized. I told him my concerns about crew exposure and aircraft contamination. I even pointed out the possibility that I might be exposed. He said that I shouldn't be exposed; and I gladly conceded that point. I was glad because it meant that I could go home after the remaining 2 flights (even if I had to do so the next day) without being stuck in quarantine. However; in the absence of testing; I wanted to make sure certain areas of the aircraft were sanitized and that I had a new crew.  This is because I considered the aircraft to be potentially contaminated and the flight attendants (although professional) to be unfit to fly.  The flight attendants shared the same opinion about themselves.We disagreed on the need for sanitization. He expressed the belief that the coronavirus does not linger on surfaces. This belief grossly contradicts scientific literature which explains that the coronavirus can linger on smooth surfaces for up to 3 days. During the discussion; he mentioned that I could be making career decisions here. I then calmly asked if my career was being threatened. He said no. But his statement about career decisions can only be interpreted as a thinly veiled threat against my career.As the Captain; I said that I wanted to make sure that some areas were sanitized. I would have gladly accepted any type of action that could be interpreted as sanitization or reassurance thereof. But the Flight Manager flatly said no without giving any explanation. This is essentially saying that he will not allow me to receive these services regardless of their availability. This is a direct attack on my authority as the Captain.As the Captain; I also asked for new flight attendants because I considered them to be unfit to fly (due to their circumstances). The Flight Manager flatly said no without giving any explanation. This prevented me from getting a new crew regardless of their availability. This is another direct attack on my authority as a Captain.The Flight Manager then pressed me on answering if I will accept the flight. From my standpoint as the Captain; that is asking me if I am willing to fly a potentially contaminated aircraft with an unfit crew. I said no. The Flight Manager retaliated by giving me a Missed Assignment. At this point; it became a clear case of Pilot Pushing enforced with retribution.Potential COVID exposure; Management wanting to launch a flight without proper safety precautions; Flight Manager trying to override the Captain's authority; Pilot pushing enforced by retaliationDo not try to override the Captain's authority; especially when the Captain has a safety concern.
Environment - Non Weather Related,So there we were; the best Captain & FO (First Officer) in the fleet; approximately 11 miles right in trail of [a company aircraft] from waypoint WSTIN direct to TCC ( for approx 590 nm). About 40 east of TCC the winds shifted so that they were straight on the nose and therefore we became directly in [the other aircraft's] wake turbulence. I directed the FO to offset 1L which he did and then he called to request the offset from ATC. Albuquerque approved. And then they immediately came back and said to call them with a possible pilot deviation; which I did after landing. The autopilot in the jet is programmed to take a very aggressive bid (45 degree cut or more) to get on the offset. I believe this aggressive bid is what triggered Albuquerque 's concern as the traffic was well outside of 10 miles with no loss of separation when the jet completed the offset.
Weather,Captain landed Runway XX and once he began to slow down; the aircraft began to slide off the runway due to possible unreported icing conditions for the runway. The aircraft had damage to the prop due to hitting multiple runway lights and ended up sliding off into a ditch from the ice.
Aircraft,"Approximately 9 miles north of the field; 3-4 miles east of the extended centerline for Runway XX at ZZZ; we were level at 2;000 ft. on a base leg for a visual approach to Runway XX in VMC. We received a terrain"" caution; followed immediately with a ""pull-up"" terrain warning. The Captain disconnected the autopilot (AP) and initiated a climb to 2;500 ft.; and I notified ATC. There were no obvious obstructions or terrain near us - highest obstacle on the approach plate [was] 995 ft.; and I believe that was behind us. The terrain warning cleared as the Captain disconnected the AP and initiated the climb. We then proceeded back to 2000 ft. and completed the approach and landing into ZZZ. Unknown cause; possible EGPWS malfunction vs interference of unknown origin."""
Aircraft,While climbing enroute; ZZZ Center held us at FL210 for 3-5 minutes; assumably due to traffic. In that period; we had a dual bleed air master caution light illuminate. We followed the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and immediately corrected the situation. Per the QRH; we elected to continue with caution. However; if we received the same master caution; we would divert to our nearest suitable airport as a precaution. We were issued a climb to FL410. Climbing through FL310; we received the dual bleed air light master caution again. We advised ATC that we need to stop the climb at FL320. However; for direction; we had to descend back to FL310. We again began to troubleshoot using the QRH when we also got a DUCT OVHT light. I checked the temperature indicator on the cabin and cockpit duct valves which indicated fully pegged towards the highest setting; although the actual mechanical switches had not been operated yet. This indicated to me that we had either a fire or ignition for a fire to begin in the tail cone section of the airplane.We immediately [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Center and advised them that we need to descend immediately and will be diverting to ZZZ1. We followed the emergency memory items for expedited descent and were cleared to FL240. The First Officer began to troubleshoot using the QRH while I began to manually fly the plane into the descent to ensure we still had control effectiveness; thankfully; we did. Descending through roughly 16;000 ft. we had the bleed lights extinguished and about one minute later; the DUCT light extinguished as well. While configuring for the approach; we had noticed a small sort of vibration or rattling in the plane that was concerning. With that; we advised ZZZ1 Tower that we will be evacuating the aircraft on the runway if there was a visible fire; if not; we will evacuate on the first taxiway available. They advised that there was no smoke present; so we made the decision to exit the runway and evacuate immediately upon clearing due to the nature and location of the potential fire.
Company Policy,I operated Aircraft X with Captain X.  The next day I received a text message saying that his sore throat on that leg became aches and chills and his COVID test was positive.  I worked three days with Captain (CA) Y.  On the first leg; he was audibly sniffling. I asked if he felt OK; he said it was allergies due to a soapy smell in the flight deck. The next leg; new airplane; constant sniffling with a very intermittent cough. I was told he had dry pipes; and it was just his allergies. I put my mask on for the remainder of the flight. And informed CA Y; he sounded terrible. The next day the running nose continued. CA Y; was seated behind me on DH; audible sniffling was so constant I relocated my seat.  He text the next day saying he was so exhausted he slept twelve hours. I stated we can add fatigue to your COVID symptoms. On the van he verbally told me he woke up incredibly sweaty.My work health; and safety was negatively affected by CA X and Captain Y; lacking the personal responsibility of following company guidelines for reporting to work. Those expectations are laid out in pilot bulletin for revised coronavirus guidance.Pilot bulletin also sets an expectation of contacting medlink; the symptomatic pilot donning an N95; and containing himself to the flight deck.
Ambiguous,Helicopters in the SFRA around Washington; DC area have been increasingly asked to use 125.65 for departures and arrivals into and out of the SFRA. The frequency works ok within about 20 miles of the DCA VOR but beyond about 20 miles; even at altitudes of 2000 feet AGL TRACON has a difficult time understanding radio communications from us. This morning's flight I had to switch to another frequency to clear the SFRA (128.35). It was actually the same Controller as was on the problem frequency of 125.65. I explained we were having issues with communications on 125.65; and that I could reach him on other frequencies. The Controller claimed he would submit a trouble report on his end. I had a similar trouble the previous day on the same frequency of 125.65 and had to resort to another frequency. This problem has been going on for about a month now. The eastern and southern sectors of the SFRA seem to be the area where the most problems occur trying to use 125.65.
Human Factors,After clearing the Runway 36L at AUS on Taxiway G; Ground Control issued us taxi instructions:  'G; C; West Ramp on C.  The First Officer then went off frequency to call Operations. Just before reaching taxiway C; I looked to my left in the direction of the upcoming turn and saw a Aircraft Y; moving southbound on C at about 30-40 knots. I had to slam on my brakes in order to avoid a collision. I then made a snarky remark to the Ground Controller that a head's up about Aircraft Y jet would have been appreciated. He apologized and said something to us to indicate that he had been distracted by ramp traffic and airplanes waiting to get to gates. This could have been a catastrophic collision had I not been glancing to my left.  Recommend a dedicated ramp controller that deals with ramp traffic thereby allowing the Ground Controller to monitor and control the movement area.Ground Control distracted with ramp congestion and never told us about other aircraft.Suggest a dedicated Ramp Control frequency and Controller.
Aircraft,Upon walking into aircraft in ZZZ and during the preflight phase; we smelled dirty socks fumes. We immediately called maintenance to the aircraft. 3 technicians confirmed the fumes and had us make a logbook entry. We were instructed to turn off the APU bleed and a few minutes later; Operations has us deplane the passengers. Our entire crew subsequently deplaned.
Ambiguous,On our arrival to West Palm Beach; we were cleared to descend to 2;000 ft. and to expect the visual approach to [Runway] 10L. I told the First Officer I'd like to begin the visual approach at ZISUR which is the final approach fix and glide slope intercept for the ILS 10L. The approach controller gave us vectors inside of ZISUR. We turned as instructed and a little while later he asked us did we see the airport. We said we did and were cleared for the visual approach. As we were at 2;000 ft and inside ZISUR we were above the glide path.  I descended as necessary to be on glide path. We were in total VFR conditions. At this time the controller said he had an altitude alert. We continued with our approach and we were fully configured and stable at 1;000 ft as per our SOP. We landed as normal.
Aircraft,"The day-to-day operations at ZZZ Line Maintenance is that all Line / Zones X - B work the through flights and [the] Hangar works OOS (Out of Service) aircraft and other scheduled maintenance tasks requiring longer ground time. Normally; no one from the Line / Zone is sent to [the] Hangar to work OOS aircraft since it reduces manpower to work through flights. Aircraft go OOS daily and there have been many occasions when OOS aircraft are parked at the Hangar waiting for manpower to be available. But even at that time; no one from the Line / Zone are sent to [the] Hangar to work OOS aircraft. The aircraft remains parked until [the] Hangar has manpower available to work. But on Date; it all changed. As a licensed A&P technician it is my duty and obligation to report known discrepancies. While working the Line / Zone Y; I reported two discrepancies on Aircraft X for cracks in vertical pressure deck web. Both of these cracks were verified by QC Inspector on log pages X and Y. Everyone knows how catastrophic; deadly; dangerous; and damaging vertical pressure deck web cracks can be. Immediately after that; I was re-assigned and sent to [the] Hangar to follow the OOS aircraft and start [the] open up for required sheet metal repair; which was out of the norm.When I arrived at [the] Hangar; the Lead Tech had already assigned other technicians to work this aircraft. Sending me to the Hangar did not alleviate any manpower shortages there; but created a shortage of manpower to work through flights at Line / Zone Y. This added unnecessary additional burden to work through flights on remaining technicians in Line / Zone Y. This was done clearly to punish; retaliate; single out; harass; discriminate; intimidate; threaten and create fear to report known discrepancies.On that day the following policies were ignored by management team: [company core values]. Instead; the following were used by the management team on duty: Punishment; Retaliation; Intimidation; Discrimination; Harassment; Threatening; [and] Fear tactics. Since this has happened; it has created a lot of animosity and anxiety among other technicians to come forward and report discrepancies in fear of retaliation and harassment. This makes for a hostile work environment for all and puts safety at risk. Unfortunately; it is becoming common practice"" and ""normal"" here at ZZZ to retaliate only against technicians who report known discrepancies under the Director and his management team.Knowing the potential hazard posed by vertical pressure deck web cracks; no one from the management team has come forward and said; ""Good find; let's get this fixed."" Instead; they opted to punish and retaliate against [the] Technician for reporting [the] discrepancy. A disgraceful and shameful behavior from entire ZZZ Management Team involved."""
Human Factors,While enroute to Ontario eastbound along V186; ATC gave me a vector of 050 for airway spacing for an aircraft ahead of me on the airway. The initial vector took me towards the mountains north of the airway. After a few minutes; ATC then intended for me to turn back southbound on a 160 heading to rejoin the airway; however I turned to a 060 heading instead which continued to send me towards the mountains instead of away from them as intended. The controller then gave me a descent from 7;000 ft. down to 6;000 ft. which I read back and complied with. After a minute or so; the controller issued an immediate turn to the south as well as a low altitude alert and an instruction to climb back up to 7;000 ft. I complied and reinstated a climb back to 7;000 ft. as instructed. I then rejoined the airway and proceeded as normal.Without hearing the ATC audio of the heading instruction to turn back southbound; it is unclear if the instruction given to me was '160' and I simply misheard him and my incorrect read back was missed; or if an instruction of '060' was given by mistake even though he intended for me to turn to 160. Either way; as the PIC (Pilot in Command) I should've spoken up sooner and clarified with ATC on the heading as it did not make sense to be descending towards rising terrain. Also speaking slowly and clearly on the radios; even when it is busy; could've made it more likely that the controller would've heard the incorrect read back and corrected the situation that way. Overall; there was miscommunication on both sides and more diligence needs to be taken from myself to speak up and clarify things if they do not make sense.
Human Factors,Take-off initiated with left cargo door opened. Initially; left pilot door was suspected to have unlocked during the take-off roll and/or ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) headset malfunctioning (in the past; ANC headset failure resulted in the same noise and vibration produced by the cargo door open). For that reason; realization about the left door unlatched status was achieved just after having lifted-off.Strong glare and a take-off facing the sun; plus habit to the more conspicuous annunciator panel of the legacy 208 version versus the G1000 CAS system made me miss the 'door unlatched' CAS message.A return to land was requested and a pattern performed normally. After landing and the runway vacated; the door was closed with no damage found. A runway inspection revealed that a spray bottle of window cleaner and a pair of headsets had been sucked out from the cargo door pocket and fallen in the pavement at the beginning of the runway.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On descent into Denver on the NIIXX.3 arrival over HUDPI intersection at approximately 12;500 ft a drone with a white light came in proximity to the First Officer windscreen. Notified Denver Approach of the drone.
Software and Automation,While enroute ZZZ-ZZZ1 our center hydraulic quantity started decreasing. While reviewing the appropriate non-normal checklists in [App]; the application crashed twice. We had to close and restart it each time; which resulted in a loss of all open tabs. Essentially we had to start the checklists over from the beginning.This happens frequently (like once or twice per trip). [App] just freezes sometimes -- it doesn't matter whether you're connected to the internet or not.Flight Operations wants to remove paper QRH's from the airplanes. This absolutely cannot be allowed to happen until we have a replacement system that works 100% of the time.
Environment - Non Weather Related,While being vectored for the ILS 10L at PBI; we experienced a radar altitude indication of zero; first intermittently; then continuously. As a result; the airplane's EGPWS system sounded multiple alerts and alarms (TERRAIN; PULL UP; SINK RATE; DON'T SINK; and TOO LOW: GEAR) continuously during the vector to final and during the final approach itself. The error began at a location approximately 20 NM northwest of the PBI; immediately after turning to heading 210 on a left base for Runway 10L outside of WILBA Intersection; and continued through interception and descent until approximately 2 miles inside of ZISUR (final approach fix) at approximately 1;400 feet.During this time; the radio altimeter on the Captain's side read zero; first intermittently then continuously; while the First Officer's radio altimeter read correctly. The PIC reports that the issue has occurred previously; though not for such a long duration. The issue only occurs at PBI (never other airports); only for Runway 10L (never 28R); only on left base (never right); and only when being vectored out to or outside of WILBA (never while on a tighter visual approach). This suggests a cause that is local to the area north of the WILBA Intersection.Company maintenance; Chief Pilot; and ATC were advised of this and previous occurrences.The alarms represent a significant distraction during a critical phase of flight; and in IMC the conflicting RA data could be a threat to safety.
Human Factors,Got HAZMAT form and forgot to call Dispatch to do a pen and ink change to show HAZMAT onboard in remarks of Release.
Aircraft,Departing Runway XXR; after rotation the left engine was surging 85% to 103%; while the right engine was surging from 90% to 103%; causing a yawing moment. We elected to return for landing.
Aircraft,Today on Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1 we experienced a hydraulic system 3 low pressure warning shortly after getting vectored onto the final approach course for ILS Runway XX in VMC conditions. We saw the caution message and checked the hydraulic synoptic page to see that there was no fluid left in our hydraulic 3 system; but there was pressure in the line. We asked for delay vectors and discontinued our approach to run the QRH. After running the QRH we got to the gear extension portion and after talking it through decided to drop the gear using the conventional method. The gear went down and locked 3 green; however the pressure was completely depleted in system 3 after that. We decided to pull the manual gear extension in case the reading was faulty as advised by the QRH. We ran the rest of the QRH procedure and [requested priority handling] with the Tower. After all checklists were run we were vectored back onto the approach. I was the FO was flying during the checklist and procedure. After the procedure was completed we decided that the Captain should land the aircraft and we transferred the controls to his side and I took over the job of pilot monitoring. We landed the plane safely and let ATC know that we would not be able to exit the runway. ARFF was standing by to inspect the aircraft for leaks and none were found. We contacted Dispatch and Maintenance via ACARS while on the ground and informed them of the situation. Once inspected by ARFF a tug towed us into the gate.Not sure what the cause was; there were no other indications during flight that caused alarm until close to the airport when we received the caution message.
Aircraft,Normal take off with engine anti ice on. Climbing out of FL 180 and requesting level off at FL 190; we had a LVL 1 ENG3 FADEC MAINT at XA:00. Followed by a BANG sound. Right after that initially N1 rolled back Past 41% to X. followed by N1-X; EGT-X; N2-X and oil temp -X. At that point; I instructed the FO to secure #3 engine and do the ENG3 severe damage checklist. [Requested priority handling]; requested 11 min of fuel dump and set up for the ILS to Runway XXR ZZZ. At XA:14 we also had a LVL1 GEN OFF. We returned to ZZZ taxied to the gate with no further incident; auto pilots also had difficulty trying to maintain altitude when descent was initiated. Dumped 11 minutes of fuel.
Aircraft,After takeoff landing gear handle would not move to the up position. Ran the 'Gear handle will not move to the up position' checklist which has you push the handle release button and move the handle to the up position. The main landing gear retracted but the nose gear remained down. This led to the 'Gear primary or secondary light(s) illuminate with gear handle up' checklist which has you lower the gear and maintain speed. Gear lowered and was verified down and locked. Requested priority handling with ZZZ Approach and requested vectors. Then ran the 'Ground sensor failure' checklist as ground shift had not occurred. Received vectors to ILS [Runway] XXC; ran normal checklists and made an uneventful landing. Did not dump fuel or request equipment however Fire/Rescue was standing by. On landing rollout the nose gear seemed to settle or compress to a low position with an unusual vibration. Stopped on runway and had Fire/Rescue inspect the nose gear; they reported that the nose gear appeared normal. Cleared the runway and taxied to parking uneventfully.
Procedure,Maintenance techs were complying with RON package for aircraft. They were completing task card # XXXXXXXX under work order # XXXXXX. Upon removal of panels to access O2 generators they found safety pins that prohibit activation of O2 generators still installed.I was made aware of something this evening that I feel must be passed on to you. We had Aircraft X at the hangar tonight as a RON.  Included in the package was task task card # XXXXXXXX; Verify Lanyard Alignment for O2 Generators.  Aircraft was being worked on by Name 1; Name 2;  and Name 3. When they removed the panel to gain access to the generators they found that several of the generators had the safety pin that prevents the generator from being activated still installed with a red safety flag attached. Two of these generators were located at the emergency exit doors.  Had we not had this job card to perform this would not have been found. This aircraft was just released from Heavy Check today; and this was the very first flight after maintenance. I believe the event occurred due to complacency and failure to follow proper protocols after maintenance.Had this aircraft been carrying passengers and an actual emergency happened where these masks were needed several passengers would not  have been able to receive any O2. I am not exactly sure who should also be notified to check into this or what else can be done so I am sending it to you. I just feel that this should be looked into further as this is a safety of flight issue to me. It makes me wonder what else might be getting missed or overlooked at this or other facilities like this one and how do we protect the company and our passengers from situations like this.
Human Factors,I was the First Officer and Pilot Monitoring for Flight #XXXX; ZZZ1-ZZZ. The flight had been uneventful all the way through the approach. We were cleared for the visual approach to Runway XX at ZZZ; and after contacting Tower; we were given our landing clearance. Aircraft were landing and departing on Runway XX as well as departing on Runway XYR. I did not specifically hear a takeoff clearance for an aircraft for Runway XX while we were on final. At 400 ft. AGL; an aircraft entered Runway XX. The Captain said out loud that this didn't look right and I commented that the aircraft may be crossing the runway where an FBO is on the other side but it seemed closer than what the Tower usually allowed. The aircraft then made the ninety degree turn to lineup on the runway and immediately started taking off. At that instant the Captain already said he was going around; and before I could say anything [to] the Tower; the Controller directed us to go-around. We were then given a right turn and altitude to climb. The Captain performed a smooth and normal go-around and we were handed off to Departure. Approach re-vectored us for the visual back to Runway XX; where we landed without further incident and taxied to the gate.Go-around when an aircraft entered red landing runway while on short final.
Human Factors,On downwind on the east side of COS flying northbound; the FO/PF (First Officer/Pilot Flying) said he had the field in sight and we were cleared [for] the visual approach to [Runway] 17R. The PF mentioned planning to roll out on about a 3-4 mile final and I cleared the FMS up to AGHU on the RNAV approach as he requested. The PF began to configure early so I inquired about it and he said he still wanted to configure; so I did; as he called for flaps and gear. As he turned the base leg I told him he was way too low out here; that the terrain rises to the north; and that the white bar on the altimeter is indicating 1000 ft. above field elevation but the field was 4-5 miles southwest of our position and that our Radio Altimeter was between 600-700 feet AGL. At that point; COS tower asked about our situation and mentioned that he had received a low altitude alert from his equipment in the tower. I replied that we were ok. As the PF turned his base to final early; I told him 'that's the wrong runway; the runway is that way' and I pointed to where he needed to aim the jet. The PF mentioned something to the fact that he had been looking at the incorrect runway (17L) and I believe this is the main reason he had configured and descended so early. I believe the main cause was a combination of the PF not being very familiar with the airfield and local area and accepting a visual approach at night without continuously backing up what he was seeing outside vs the instruments inside the cockpit that had the instrument approach loaded to the correct runway. I could have asked more/better questions about what he was seeing or why he was wanting to configure so early. That might have uncovered some clues to me that the PF was looking at the incorrect runway and not cross checking with his instruments.
Human Factors,As we were switched over to Bogota FIR; it was very hard to understand the Controller because there was a high pitched squeal on the radio. I felt like my SA (Situational Awareness) started to go down at this point because I was focusing on trying to understand the Controller. I misunderstood multiple clearances and had to ask twice for the clearance. We were given the RNAV RNP X 31L. The Captain and I had briefed and gone over the points on both the STAR and approach multiple times each. We were finally headed to AMVES when we were cleared direct to BO710. We briefed [that] we were going to do our LAVS 1 nm prior to this point. 1 nm mile prior the Captain rolled in 8400 feet in the MCP alt window. For some reason we were stuck in VNAV ALT. She selected 500 fpm down on the VS to get us going down and quickly selected VNAV again. We were high on the path and realized we were past the final approach point about the same time we got a terrain caution. The Captain called for a go around at this point. I think there were many contributing factors that led to this event. First of all I have less than 75 hours in the airplane as well as having never been to Bogota before. My SA started going down when we started to have communication issues [with] Bogota center. I had trouble understanding clearances which contributed to my task saturation. We briefed and checked points multiple times on the first approach going into [Runway] 31 as well as the LAVS procedure. I think since we had such a high ground speed between high altitude and tail wind that may have caused us to be high on the path before we had a chance to get on it. Taking the clearance direct to BO710 as opposed to taking direct AMVES did us no favors. I was task saturated and unfortunately was not as good of a backup as I should have been.
Aircraft,Shortly after gear retraction; I heard an electrical pop and looked down to see a shower of sparks coming from beneath the instrument panel raining down on my legs. I immediately requested left traffic to return to land on Runway XXR at ZZZ. After the initial pop and sparking; there were no further indications of malfunctioning equipment or any signs of smoke or electrical smell. I returned to land without further incident. [Tower called for fire rescue]. The equipment followed me from the runway to the parking spot. The firemen collected my information and used a thermal camera to look for hot spots on the panel.
Weather,On rollout/runway exit; [Runway] XXR to [Taxiway] XX; braking action good on Runway; FICON 5/5/5; from a near stop we exited onto [taxiway] and the aircraft began to slide sideways. Once clear of the runway; with throttle to idle and brakes applied; aircraft continued to slide off taxiway into grass. Aircraft stopped. Powered up to get on [taxiway].
Aircraft,A Hung Start on ENG #1 was detected in ECAM display. During second start attempt a Hot Start and EGT over-limit showed on ECAM display. At the same time radio calls from adjacent aircraft reported fire coming from ENG #1. Reports about fire were confirmed more than once by radio from witnesses. Situation was reported to Ramp Control; ARFF (Airport Rescue Fire Fighting) was requested. Captain called for 'Engine Fire on the ground checklist'. Checklist was performed by First Officer; fire was suppressed and confirmed from outside personnel. ARFF personnel did not arrived to our aircraft when requested. Once situation was under control; the plane was towed back to the gate.
Human Factors,We were working [a flight] to ZZZ1 there was a spill of a red unknown liquid inside pit 4. Someone called Maintenance to see if they could identify what kind of liquid. Maintenance could not identify what kind a liquid and they refused to clean it. Then the Supervisor gave us the order to clean it and we (the crew working the flight) refused to do it because we did not know what type of liquid it was
Aircraft,On climb out at approximately FL230 we got a loud vibration/ noise. I checked the electrical synoptic page; shortly after the right generator went yellow then shut down. We ran the appropriate checklists starting with the GEN 2 OFF BUS which led to inflight shutdown and a single engine approach and landing.A combination of self awareness and systems info available in the cockpit allowed us to isolate the problem.We suspect the cause to be a failed generator.Our reaction was in line with the SOPs for single engine operations.Single engine operations in a mountainous environment can be especially challenging and should be taken into account in training.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Intercepting the ILS 16R from heading 140; level 4;000; cleared for the approach. Speed assigned 170. Flaps 5 selected. At ILS GP and course intercept experienced wake turbulence. Brief stick shaker due to wake turbulence roll. Added power; recovered; stayed on ILS path and advised ATC of the encounter. Turned back on auto pilot/ throttle and shortly confirmed we were good to continue the approach. Landed without incident.Carry more speed above yellow bar; I could have configured to flaps 10.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,After landing [Runway] 16R; were given instructions to back taxi on [Runway] 16C to Taxiway M; and hold on [Taxiway] M. While there are taxiway signs when taxiing in that direction there is no plastic insert with a taxiway designation when you are taxiing northbound on [Runway] 16C. In fact; there are several locations where this exists all over the airport. I suspect it is due to times long ago when operations such as back taxiing did not occur; probably before the installation of [Runway] 16R. It is very challenging to see surface paint when there is any rain; let along moderate to heavy rain like this particular evening; illuminated signs would be very helpful.  It would be a nice safety project to add these taxiway signs to facilitate turning off at the right locations. Please add these signs for ease in determining where you are.
Aircraft,During cruise at FL340 approximately 150 miles east of ZZZ; the Flight Attendants called to report an odor in the main cabin. The smell was described as 'propane or some kind of gas' and was reported by multiple passengers around row 28. After running the QRC; and no known or suspected source of the odor; we decided to execute a divert to ZZZ1. We requested priority handling.During the approach through approximately 10k feet; after a 'descend and maintain 8 thousand' we got an RA with a climb command. I (FO [First Officer] and PF [Pilot Flying]) disengaged all automation and climbed until resolved. The rest of the approach and landing was uneventful; and a heavyweight (167k) landing was accomplished. Paramedics were available at the gate upon arrival to Gate X at ZZZ1. Though we were given vectors after requesting priority handling; it seemed like ATC dropped us out of their crosscheck; as evidenced by the RA. I obviously wasn't on their scope though; and it's possible the RA was caused by an aggressively climbing contact below.Fairly cut and dry divert; minus the RA.
Aircraft,Upon arrival at the gate in ZZZ I received a call from one of our aft flight attendants during deplaning. The FA's (Flight Attendants) in the rear of the aircraft reported feeling ill due to a strong chemical odor which commenced shortly after the top of descent and gradually grew stronger until touchdown. They reported that the smell was sweet; very; acute; abrasive to the throat and nauseating. They believed that the smell was nearly strong enough to justify utilizing O2 bottles but decided not to.As soon as I was made aware of the problem the aircraft was written up and per the request of both affected FA's. Paramedics were called. Multiple attempts by multiple crew members to medical assist company yielded very unsatisfactory results. Long hold times were followed by little if any helpful advice that I have been made aware of.Get rid of medical assist company. From what I have gathered from the affected flight attendants medical assist company services added more stress and anxiety to an already stressful situation.
Weather,PM (Pilot Monitoring) recorded ATIS information from ZZZ and the PF (Pilot Flying) briefed the approach accordingly. Runway conditions were expected to be wet; and braking reported as 5/5/5. Approach to land was stable; with touchdown occurring within the touchdown zone. Ground flaps and brakes were applied according to CE-525B operating procedures. Braking action was consistent to wet runway conditions with no issues of traction or stopping power as experienced by the PF. PIC (Pilot in Command) requested controls from SIC (Second in Command) to further test the braking action. Prior to the transfer of controls; the aircraft was nearing normal taxi speed. Transfer of controls was made; and the PIC determined the braking was excellent and returned controls to the SIC. (Prior to exiting the runway; a communication from another aircraft was heard on Tower frequency reporting they had clipped taxiway lights and braking nil while exiting at the end of the parallel runway.) PF slowed the aircraft to a near stop and exited the runway at [Taxiway] XX. Once the aircraft was turned and exiting the runway; PF informed the PM that sliding was occurring and there was no directional or stopping control. The aircraft slid laterally and came to a stop with the left main in the grass on the left side of [Taxiway] XX exiting the runway. Break thrust was applied in an attempt to move out of the grass and the aircraft began sliding again; making a left 270 spin. With both engines at idle; the aircraft was again sliding laterally. The left engine was then shut down which stopped the slide. ATC was notified and checklists were performed. The aircraft was towed from XX to [the] hangar where post flight actions were conducted.
Aircraft,Taking off from ZZZ the aircraft was nose heavy for rotation / liftoff requiring additional aft yoke force. At the time; this was attributed to an inaccurate takeoff trim setting. When landing in ZZZ1; RNAV (RNP) RWY XX; at approximately 20-30 feet a pitch control input to initiate the landing flare was initiated. There was no pitch response to the initial aft yoke control input. The aft force was immediately increased to an estimated 2-3 times the initial force. Aircraft pitch suddenly increased as commanded. The aircraft ballooned slightly and was landed without incident. During taxi to the gate; the flight controls were checked by moving the yoke forward and aft to the limits of movement. The control forces felt excessive and not completely free. A logbook entry was made; Maintenance was called; and ZZZ1 station ops manager was informed.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Planned and flew a visual approach backed up by ILS14 to SRQ in great VMC. HUD was in NP mode on Aircraft X. Last valid call I remember was 'plus 100'. At approximately minimums (200 AGL); HUD indications shimmered; then blinked; and then filled display with all kinds of data/warnings; to include what I believe was the attitude lines of the unusual attitude recovery mode; largely blocking all direct view through the HUD and making it impossible to use and difficult to look through. At approximately 150 ft. AGL (estimated by looking out window); GPWS flare call outs began to count down 50;40; etc like aircraft wanted me to flare. I was way too high for that. FO (First Officer); Pilot Monitoring stated 'That's not right' and asked me what was going on. I said I lost HUD and was proceeding visually. I was able to 'Fly through the HUD' ignoring its information to a normal landing. He said he saw no other indications.I have no idea [of the cause]. HUD was inop from 200 ft. down. I talked to another Captain; and he told me to treat it like a failure and put in AML which we did. We both understood that 5G is not supposed to be on yet; so elected to treat as failure. Maintenance could find no faults in subsequent checks and signed it off. Next leg was no problem. Delayed flight about an hour. Maintenance stated that they have gotten several reports on different aircraft this week similar to this; but do not know the cause.It is quite possible that 5G testing is going on that we do not know about. Also; quite possible it is just a glitch; another software issue; other interference; or just broken. I suggested to Maintenance that they begin tracking these odd events by airport as well as aircraft. Had it been a low IMC approach; I would probably had to exercise a missed.
Aircraft,Issue was a Power Brake Failure on approach and landing phase of flight. Flight was a Part 135 revenue flight from ZZZ; to ZZZ1. This was the second leg of the day after a Part 91 reposition leg from ZZZ2; to ZZZ. Preflight inspection in ZZZ2 was normal and did not reveal any issues with the brake system or its components. Taxi checks on both legs did not reveal any issues with either pilot or co pilot brake pedals and pressure. Flight began normally and all phases until approach were normal. We were vectored by ZZZ1 Approach to the RNAV XXR approach at ZZZ2. We were cleared for the approach at 2500 feet MSL in VMC conditions outside of the IF of ZZZZZ. We had the airport in sight and the autopilot was engaged. Once the PIC called for gear down I lowered the gear and we both immediately noticed that the Power Brake Low Press and Anti Skid Inop lights on the annunciator panel did not extinguish normally and remained on for the duration of the flight. This indicates as per the abnormal checklist a 'Power Brake System Failure' The PIC and I both tested our brake pedals and neither one had pressure. We both decided to continue to a landing on runway XXR as it had more than adequate runway available. Runway XXR at LZZZ2 is 6;101 feet long. We briefed that the landing would be using the Emergency Brake Lever. Touchdown was in the touchdown zone of the runway at Vref. PIC NAME utilized the Emergency Brake Lever and brought us nearly to a full stop before taxiway D and we were able to roll clear of the runway on this high speed exit. I as Pilot Monitoring did contact Tower once we were on the ground that we had a potential brake issue and might roll to the end of the runway and exit there. We stopped clear of the runway on taxiway D. We decided to taxi in slowly and made it to the FBO where we shut down and contacted company. Post flight revealed both sight gauges full of fluid and the accumulator was in the yellow arc with battery on indicating a lower than normal condition. When the battery was switched on the accumulator motor was not heard.
Aircraft,Upon approach to ZZZ we configured normally; the indications of a power brake failure are always illuminated upon landing gear extension. However; they extinguish after the power brake accumulator reaches sufficient pressure. The lights did not extinguish; indicating an actual power brake failure. We told ATC we needed to go missed and troubleshoot. We went missed to the west and took vectors. We did not retract the gear since we would be unable to troubleshoot the power brakes with the gear retracted. After running the manufacturer abnormal checklist we had determined we would be landing with only emergency braking. While on vectors; I transferred controls to the non flying pilot and briefed that I would be briefing the passengers in the cabin of our precautionary landing and what to expect. I did not want them to panic and do something out of the ordinary. They were briefed and calm when I left for the flight deck and knew what to expect. We accepted vectors for the ILS runway XX and landed normally in normal configuration. We stopped the aircraft as briefed without using the emergency brake lever as it was not necessary; but was available if we needed it. We hand landed and stopped within 5;000 feet of a 12;000 foot runway. Crash and fire rescue (CFR) approached and chocked us per our request since we had no parking brake. I exited the aircraft normally and spoke to CFR. After we had determined the area was safe the passengers asked to exit; which they did. Airport ops offered to give our passengers (pax) a ride to the FBO along with their luggage; I thanked them for that. The pax left and we waited for a tug to remove us from the runway and take us to the FBO. I asked CFR if they needed any information; they said they did not. The aircraft was written up for a power brake failure upon arrival to the FBO; Chief Pilot and Director of Operations were contacted due to notifying ATC. After they were informed; Maintenance was called to address the  issue and normal maintenance procedures began.I believe we acted in the best interest of safety; and complied with all established procedures. We as a crew believed notifying ATC was the correct action for an abnormal landing.
Human Factors,We were on Short final Runway XX at ZZZ. The ATIS was reporting WINDSHEAR ADVSRY. We were experiencing a mostly steady crosswind that was decreasing in magnitude as we made our descent. I was the Pilot Flying and upon disconnecting the autopilot at 500 ft.; I immediately started to drift above glideslope. In correcting; I over compensated; resulting in GPWS Alerts 'SINK RATE' 'GLIDE SLOPE' and 'PULL UP'. By this time we were in the runway environment; with what seemed like good corrections; slightly low on glideslope over the threshold. Thinking as I entered the crosswind flare I had made good corrections; we touched down in the Touchdown Zone safely. After landing we realized we should have executed a terrain avoidance maneuver with the Pull Up Warning.I was not prepared mentally to see that Warning in that context. I was more anticipating a Windshear Alert in that scenario and was surprised at the Pull Up Warning. I hesitated and followed through with the landing when I should have executed the terrain avoidance maneuver.
Aircraft,Uncommanded Windshear alert and weather radar test function activation on takeoff Runway 04R  in low speed regime. Rejected takeoff; appropriate QRC and QRH accomplished. Returned for takeoff Runway 04L. Same aircraft malfunction occurred. Second rejected takeoff was performed in low speed regime. Subsequently returned to gate and swapped aircraft. Appropriate ELB entry was made.
Aircraft,Started #2 Engine only after pushback for single engine taxi with a sharp left turn from gate. The air system was configured with both packs supplied by APU air during after start flows and remained in that configuration for taxi. Upon the start of taxi we both started to smell something bad. Not smoke; not acrid; but foul. At first I wondered if the First Officer had a gastrointestinal event but it was stronger and different than what would be expected from that. Then; he mentioned that he smelled it too. It was the smell of previously documented cases of wet sock or gym smell. The aircraft; coincidentally; had been written up on it's previous flight for this smell. We stopped our taxi on taxiway Alpha and were eventually moved short of D on A. The packs were turned off at this point. The First Officer donned his O2 mask and I opened my window for ventilation We coordinated with station MX; Ops; and Ramp Control for a gate return. I wrote up the event the best I could with the 4 lines provided in ACARS. MX met us after the parking check and I filled out the MX fume checklist. The smell was only in the cockpit and lingered until we left the aircraft. You could smell it more after leaving the cockpit and then returning as our noses were getting used to the smell. I called the Chief Pilot and texted via to Dispatch that we were a gate return after I received a query from Dispatch via ACARS.
Aircraft,Approximately one hour from ZZZ on Aircraft X from ZZZ1 to ZZZ we encountered a green system low hydraulic quantity and low pressure ECAM. We performed the action items and turned off the PTU (power transfer unit) and green system engine driven pump. The Captain informed Dispatch; Maintenance; and briefed the lead Flight Attendant. We agreed with the concurrence of Dispatch that the best course of action was to continue to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and received traffic priority to ZZZ. On final approach; we performed the alternate gear extension checklist and landed on the longest runway (XXR). We stopped straight ahead due to no nose wheel steering and waited for the tug to tow us back to the gate. We completed the after landing flows; tow in checklist; and parking checklist back at the gate.The reason for my fatigue call to the Chief Pilot and scheduling following our incident was due to minimal broken sleep from the previous evening at the layover hotel. The hotel was hosting a fraternity convention and my sleep was disrupted from 1-3 am due to the occupants of the room next door. I called the front desk and they notified security to silence the fraternity party. Following the minimal disrupted rest and the stress associated with the hydraulic emergency; I felt I was not fit to continue duty and called in fatigue!
Environment - Non Weather Related,Suspected 5G EventOn an Autopilot coupled ILS approach to 7L in Anchorage we intercepted the glide slope at 2;000 ft. about a mile and a half outside the final approach fix. Just after the intercept the glide slope indicator on the PFD (Primary Flight Display) began rapidly bouncing between 1/2 dot low to 1/2 dot high. The yoke correspondingly began oscillating in short rapid forward and aft movements. The aircraft flight path remained stable. My first thought was that there was a temporary ground interference with the glide slope antenna. The oscillations began diminishing as we crossed the final approach fix at 1;600 ft. when we got a NO LAND 3 EICAS Caution advisory. About five or six seconds later the Autopilot disengaged un-commanded. I cancelled the Autopilot wailer and completed the approach manually. The entire approach was accomplished in VFR conditions This event occurred at approximately XA:20Z.I didn't get a chance to read the 5G Interference bulletin until after we landed in Anchorage. When I did it occurred to me that our event may have been a 5G interference issue.
Weather,The airport had a steady light drizzle that had accumulated on the surfaces. After deicing and anti-icing we taxied to the runway with no issues in directional control. We observed the ice sweepers sweep and treat the runway while we were being deiced (about 15-20 minutes prior). We also observed other aircraft landing on the runway with no issues. We taxied onto the runway and as I turned to line up with the centerline; the aircraft did not turn; it just kept traveling in a straight line. I kept the tiller turned and applied full brakes and we stopped short of the runway edge. We gained traction near the edge and turned back toward the center of the runway. We had the ice sweeping personnel come look if there was evidence that there was a runway excursion or contact with runway lights. No evidence was found. We waited on the runway centerline while the runway and taxiways were cleared of ice and then taxied back to the gate to refuel; as our holdover time had expired and we needed to be deiced and anti-iced again. As we were waiting; we heard that another aircraft lost directional control while taking the other runway.The cause of this event was the rapidly changing runway conditions.To avoid this incident again; I would pay more attention to the surface conditions during operations in light freezing rain. If ice is possible; line up with runway with a less sharp angle than used in normal operations.
Human Factors,We began approaching hanger both wing walkers (Name and Name1) were in place; Crew Chief (Name3) was guiding us into the gate. As we got closer to our stoppage point; I saw Name and Name1 jump. At that point the driver (Name4) pressed on the brakes. Because of the weight of the aircraft it takes time for the Goldhofer [tug] to stop. This caused the accident in colliding with the forklift. I was in the passenger's seat. As I looked back I saw when the impact occur. The driver pressed on the brakes but it takes time to stop.The accident happen because of the wands failing and the brakes on the Goldhofer.The Crew Chief notified the Operations Manager and maintenance approach the aircraft right away to inspect the engine. They were waiting to work on the aircraft. [Suggest] getting better equipment.
Aircraft,During climbout; at 15;000 feet we stopped our climb due to electrical malfunctions. We made the decision to turn back towards ZZZ after suspecting a dual generator failure. The Captain's instruments were intermittently working after the failure (left side powered by inverters; right side powered by vacuum) but conditions were visual. [Priority was requested] by the flight crew after realizing that the flaps and gear would not come down. Manual extension of the gear was performed successfully and the landing was made with zero flaps. No damage was done to the airplane; and we never had a complete electrical failure. Great CRM was used; Captain was flying visually and me (First Officer) was trimming the airplane (Captain's trim was inop after the electrical malfunction); on comms and running checklists. After touching down; all of our systems came back on (flaps; Captain's instruments and his trim; etc). The cause of this is still being determined; we believe possible a loose connection or short of some sort.
Human Factors,During the turn in ZZZ; the Ops Agent informed me of HAZMAT onboard and gave me the copies of the NOTAC. I signed both copies and returned one to the Ops Agent. I forgot to call Dispatch and amend my Release to indicate HAZMAT onboard before I departed ZZZ. En route to ZZZ1; I realized my mistake and sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to inform them that I had HAZMAT onboard. Dispatch responded and we did a pen and ink change to amend the Release to show the remark - HAZMAT on Flight-Refer to NOTAC.
Aircraft,I'm writing to address a concern that there is an issue with the B737 MAX. Since it has returned to service; after the global grounding; I have flown it at least 13 times. I previously addressed this concern with an aviation group; but my dialogue with them came to no resolution; and it appeared there wasn't much concern.The matter I want to clarify is performing the ILS test on the First Officer side. Outside of one time on Date 1; it has never functioned correctly (12 failures). It fails each time you perform the test. It functions properly on the Captain side; but not on the First Officer side. I inform the Captain of the failure and explain the Guidance Maintenance Control will probably take; which is to pull X circuit breaker; then run the test again. Many Captains are reluctant to make an entry into the Maintenance logbook. I attempt to explain that unless we write up the discrepancy; it will continue to be ignored. After nearly a year and no guidance from Flight Operations; I'm guessing it will continue to be ignored. I am not sure how to escalate the issue rather than filing a report and hoping the aviation group will explore the matter in greater detail. Please reach out to me if you have addition questions.
Aircraft,Crew was preparing to depart ZZZ on schedule when it was discovered the aircraft had been over fueled by 1;000 pounds. when the fuel sheet was consulted; it showed the aircraft fueled within tolerance at -60 gallons. This made no sense as an over fueled situation should mean the fueler filled to aircraft with more fuel than planned rather than less. Fueler's math was verified by flight crew. Pre-fueling FOB on fuel sheet corresponded exactly with what the block in fuel was on ACARS and the amount of fuel on the flight deck gauges corresponded exactly to what the fuel sheet said was on board; 23.0; which was 1;000 pounds over.A new flight plan was requested from Dispatch with the new heavier gross weight due to the extra fuel. This generated a new fuel slip with the higher fuel load. This led [to] problems later.Crew suspected a gauge error and wrote up the aircraft requesting the tanks be sticked to determine the proper amount of fuel on board. Passengers were de-boarded due to the time and cold aircraft.Maintenance verified the proper density; which was what was on the fuel sheet; and verified the math that the aircraft appeared over fueled. The tanks were sticked and it was determined that the left inboard gauge was in error and out of tolerance indicating nearly 1;000 pounds more than was actually in the tank. This was an acceptable situation per the MEL and left main inboard indicator was deferred. Passengers were boarded again. Crew prepared to depart again and the fueler showed up and put more fuel on the aircraft per the previously requested flight plan.Per the MEL; to verify the fuel in the left main; a tank stick was requested again. When this stick was done by ZZZ Maintenance; both inboard main tank gauges were discovered to be reading higher than the actual fuel on board by over 700 pounds; a combined nearly 1;500 pound error with all the implications of the crew not having as much fuel on board as planned and bad weather forecasted for the return to ZZZ in the same aircraft. Also; the MEL requires the opposite main tank gauge to work correctly and that was now in question.Maintenance then chose first try to reset the via pulling circuit breakers the fuel quantity indicating computer. This was unsuccessful. They then tried to try to replace the fuel quantity indication computer; but I have no idea how that turned out since after over 5 hours of delays; the Operations Manager ordered an aircraft swap.
Aircraft,Trigger...at FL380 was given descent to FL340. At approximately FL360; the CAB PRESS status page displayed showing a cabin altitude of 9;500 feet and rising. Action requested priority handling with ZZZ ATC; started rapid descent to 10;000 feet; seat belt sign on. First Officer (FO) and pilot flying; performed a maneuver with the autopilot on. ATC gave us initial descent to FL270 and a frequency change. New Controller gave us descent to 10;000 feet with altimeter setting of 29.80. We were in VFR conditions; minimum safe altitude from charts approximately 5;000 feet. FO was able to descend quickly enough that a CABIN ALTITUDE ECAM did not trigger nor did the oxygen masks deploy in the cabin. I was able to speak with FA1; during the descent. FA1 confirmed that passengers were okay and did not report any injuries but would update us if something changed. I made a PA to passengers about aircraft condition and plan of action. Requested all to remain seated until in ZZZ.After level off and confirming aircraft was safe to continue; removed the aircraft alert from ZZZ ATC; but requested priority handling into ZZZ. Sent ACARS message to Dispatch. Stated our problem; action; current situation and plan. Received acknowledgment and new fuel remaining calculation for Denver at 10;000 feet. Highest cabin altitude was 11;350 feet. No ECAMs showed on the upper display. Outflow valve; inlet and extract vents all showed closed. During level off; safety valve opened when cabin diff pressure at -.5 PSI. Remaining flight was uneventful to a landing at ZZZ; XXR. Taxi to Gate at XX. Met by ZZZ maintenance and ZZZ FO representative.
Ambiguous,I don't fly in and out of DEN frequently; but when I do I increasingly hear Ground Controllers getting quite agitated when we call at the spots for taxi. One time a Controller even stated; 'this must be your first time here because you're not supposed to call at the spot; I'll call you'. I've looked through our company pages and 10-9 pages and can't find any reference as to whether or not we are expected to call at the spots. If we are; in fact; not supposed to call; it would be appreciated if a note could be added to the pages.
Human Factors,Aircraft Y was exiting off of a north-complex runway at Taxiway Exit 1. Aircraft Y was instructed by North Ground Control (frequency) to make a left on Taxiway 2. Aircraft Y did not respond and was continuing towards Taxiway 1 where I was Towing an Aircraft X opposite direction to Aircraft Y. My destination was Gate X which is the end gate closest and adjacent to Taxiway 2; I was concerned that Aircraft Y was getting to close to me because my right wing would likely overlap some of Taxiway 2. Ground Control called a second time and Aircraft Y still did not respond. Finally; after 3 or 4 attempts; Aircraft Y switched to frequency and announced his exit of Runway XXL on Taxiway 1.Though this is the first time expressing my concerns; I have witnessed the same behavior/problem on two other occasions in 2020 in the south complex. One time the same Aircraft Y flight was both non-responsive and slow moving; and thereby caused me to avoid an imminent situation with another aircraft exiting a runway as I was forced to hold short of a runway exit against ATC instructions. ATC was not aware that Aircraft Y was blocking my path. I have witnessed another occasion where the same flight; Aircraft Y; stalled off a runway exit and created unnecessary congestion on the Taxiway. The consistency of Aircraft Y's mishaps is troubling as these identical problems span a period of 2 years.
Aircraft,Passing 10;000 feet we received a red U/L (Un Locked) reverser light; accompanied with a significant vibration on the number one engine. We shut down the engine in accordance with the QRH. We requested priority handling with ZZZ Center and notified Dispatcher of our intentions to return to ZZZZ. After completing all checklists and briefings we completed an uneventful auto land to [Runway] XXR. Maintenance inspection showed the reverser was partially cracked open (deployed). After landing the red U/L light turned yellow; and stayed on through shutdown. No fuel dump required.
Aircraft,On Final Approach on the ILS RWY XXL at XXX; the AVIONICS SMOKE ECAM Emergency Warning activated as the landing gear was extending. At the direction of the Captain (Pilot Flying); the First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) requested priority handling and requested Fire Fighting assistance with the initial check-in call to ZZZ Tower; and was cleared to land. Upon landing; we taxied clear of the runway onto Taxiway XX via XY. Aircraft was stopped; brakes set; and Emergency Evacuation Checklist conducted with the exception of using the slides. Initially thought we smelled fumes after landing and taxiing onto 2 taxiway. After engines and aircraft power shutdown; the smell appeared to dissipate. Fire Crew didn't find any hot spots and we coordinated for a tow to the gate.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Getting vectored to ILS 30; controller directed a descent to 2;400 feet (as heard by all three pilots) then quickly followed with a terrain alert climb to 3;000 feet call.  No GPWS alert.  Continued approach without incident.Controller misspoke or didn't realize we were still over high terrain.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On downwind for Runway 13; I set altitude pre-select to I believe 7;200 feet (1;000 ft above TDZE); when I should have chosen 7;700 (1;500 feet above TDZE) or even 8;000. Due to up sloping terrain to the north of the airport; I realized my I was getting too low visually out the cockpit window; and about the same time the gear horn went off. Shortly after ATC called with a low altitude alert. At that time I was already adding power to climb a few hundred feet in preparation for the base turn. I finished configuring the plane prior to being unstable on final; and landed without further incident.Sloppy math and poor planning. I had quickly calculated my base turn to final 1;000 feet above the field instead of 1;500. The rising terrain on the left downwind for Runway 13 made this mistake more problematic. A company reference briefing warning of the rising terrain on runway 13's left downwind could have helped as well.Flying DMA [Direct Memory Access] mostly these days; it had been a while since I've done a real visual approach in the pattern. My lack of currency and my inattention to the math led to this stupid mistake. A second corrective action would be a company briefing page for Runway 13 pattern; warning of the rising terrain to the north of the field.
Aircraft,We were to fly from ZZZ to ZZZ1. I showed up to the aircraft late since I was arriving from a different flight. When I showed up to the aircraft the Captain had completed the pre-flight procedures and then once I got settled we conducted a PDC verification (assigned ZZZ RT XXX); Departure Briefing and Pre-flight checklist. We departed Runway XX and on the takeoff roll received a caution for EFIS COMP MON. I called it out; Captain said continue. On the climb out at 400 feet the Captain's (PF) showed a left turn to 340 and asked me to set 340. I said set and then we realized his display wasn't working so we transferred controls to my side. We then leveled off at 4;000 feet notified ATC of the loss of lateral navigation and asked for vectors back to the field. As we were turning we realized my HSI was providing unreliable heading information as well. ATC gave us degree amounts for the turn and we backed it up with the standby compass. We also asked ATC for a descent into visual conditions they gave us 3;000 feet and then 2;000 feet and finally 1;600 feet. The Pilot Monitoring briefed the approach. We went to green needles and ATC gave us a heading to intercept and the ILS for XX and told us it would be a left turn. We started down with a GS lock that seemed to match ATC instructions.  ATC asked if we had the runway. We said no. The Captain then saw a tower and a bridge we got a GPWS caution and went around. We got vectors back around for a visual asked ATC to turn up the lights and used the MFD and made a normal landing.
Aircraft,Previous flight was an RON (Routine Overnight).  Dark aircraft upon crew arrival at the gate.  Started the APU and used it for air and power at gate. After both engines were started and APU bleed was deselected; we began taxi. Within approximately one minute; both the FO (First Officer) and I began smelling a strong 'dirty socks' smell in the cockpit. We deselected both packs and called the inflight to determine if they had smelled it as well. It was confirmed that they had the odor in the cabin as well. We coordinated a gate return for maintenance action.  Company report form completed. This report is being submitted solely because it is recommended: there was no cockpit crew error or deviation.
Aircraft,Electrical burning odor was coming from [middle] seat 4A.Flight attendants used PBE (Portable Breathing equipment) and Halon [fire extinguisher] on the seat.Flight Attendant passed out under the PBE and was feeling unwell after the event.2 MD's and 1 EMT attended to the Flight Attendant and deemed him fit to continue with his concurrence. Dispatch was notified and all agreed to continue to ZZZ.I asked inflight to advise me of any adverse changes enroute but there were none reported. Medical assistance met the flight in ZZZ but he refused care upon deplaning.
Aircraft,During pushback; I received a call from the Flight Attendant concerning a loud noise coming from the aircraft forward right side. At the same time; I began smelling fumes on the flight deck; so I told the Flight Attendant 'I will get back with you'.I commanded oxygen masks on and established communication. I asked the First Officer to request a return to the gate; as I performed the Flight Crew Operations Manual isolation guide checklist.Upon return to the gate; we deplaned the aircraft promptly; and the appropriate logbook entries were made.
Aircraft,Shortly after takeoff we experienced a dirty sock/fume event that was isolated only in the flight deck. Both myself and the First Officer put on our oxygen mask to abate the smell. The odor dissipated within 15 minutes of departure. Upon descent the dirty sock smell came back this time more prominent. We tried to isolate the smell by using the odor isolation procedure in the Flight Crew Operations Manuel with no help in getting the dirty sock smell to dissipate. The odor was first only in the flight deck on descent but then spread throughout the cabin.
Weather,Aircraft X was taxied to the ramp off runway XXL by local control via taxiway E; H; M; to the ramp. I was working Local and obtained approval to taxi in Aircraft X from ground control in order to discuss with the pilot braking action; and other pertinent weather information for the safety of the operation. Once Aircraft X was on taxiway H approaching taxiway M; a snow plow cut off Aircraft X and began sliding and finally came to a stop to avoid the snowplow. Airport operations had a vehicle on my frequency and heard the report and stated he would take care of it. I advised the FLM of the situation and gave him the airport operators cell phone number.  Later I was told that the plow cut off Aircraft X because they monitor the ground control frequency and never knew he was coming as I kept him on tower frequency.  Seems like the blame game is being played here because airport operations snow crew lost sight of the see and avoid aircraft. Airport operations and snow crews should monitor all frequencies at all times if the option exists.
Aircraft,At FL390 Lead FA [Flight Attendant] called up to say a burning; electrical smell was coming from forward galley overhead gasper. I had him check the ovens and coffee makers and also check for popped breakers. He said they were fine. I then had him feel the panels to see if any were hot and he said none were.We ran the Smoke Fire or Fumes checklist. It had no effect and the smell continued. I went back and confirmed it was not a burning food smell. It smelled like hot metal and oil and was not abating. The checklist directed us to divert to the nearest suitable if the fumes continued or the source could not be identified. We diverted to ZZZ.We continued the checklist while also [requesting priority handling] and notifying Dispatch. We used our oxygen masks as directed by the checklist and completed all the applicable checklists for the divert.Once we landed and cleared the runway I had [Airport Rescue & Fire Fighting support] confirm there was no visible smoke or fire and we then taxied to a gate.
Human Factors,We pushed from the gate without the Final Dangerous Goods Summary. Dangerous goods were not loaded. We did not start the taxi until after receiving the Final Dangerous Goods Summary. We pushed late do to engine deicing at the gate . Weather was a distraction.
Human Factors,"Flight from ZZZ to ZZZZ; routine through the departure and enroute phases of flight. Planning on landing on Runway XX visually; using the RNAV approach as reference. It was my first time flying into ZZZZ and the Captain had briefed me that this would be different than most operations I was used to. Descending as we approached ZZZZ; Captain asked me to cancel our IFR as we were able to maintain VFR. I complied and we were handed off from Approach to the field's UNICOM. As we began our approach; we noticed a small rain shower over where the field is located. We briefed the possibility of abandoning our approach if the rain affected our ability to see the runway. Around this time an aircraft landing in front of us called us over UNICOM to inform us that they had no issues on their approach to land and they reported improved conditions from what we previously expected.The Captain; who was flying; began a descent and I noticed he was starting to descend below the 2;300 ft. altitude at ZZZZZ."" I spoke up and reminded him of the altitude at that waypoint and he took corrective action. Passing ZZZZZ on final for the runway; he began another descent; this time down to an altitude of around 600 ft. roughly 4 miles from the runway; and it was at this time that I was able to clearly see the runway and called it in sight. However; the Captain had seen it before me since I was not familiar with this airport. Although we were still maintaining VFR; this descent put us about 600 ft. above the water still roughly 4 miles from the runway. Passing the FAF; the Captain continued down to the published minimums for the approach; rounded up to 400 ft. It was at this altitude over the land that we received a GPWS alert. This surprised us both as we were above published minimums and had visual of the runway and all land and obstacle between us and the runway in sight. The alert disappeared as I looked and noticed my RA showed 400 ft.; still above published minimums. With the alert gone [and] runway and all terrain in sight; we continued our approach to land and the remainder of the flight was uneventful.This was my first time flying into ZZZZ2; including ZZZZ; and at the time only had 60 hours in the aircraft as a First Officer. The Captain previously elected earlier in the trip to fly both legs into and out of ZZZZ since it presents unique challenges being an uncontrolled; short runway; island airport in ZZZZ2 with unique weather requirements for dispatch. During the flight the Captain explained how different this flight would be compared to what I was used to in my short time at the airline. This prepared me to expect some differences; especially in the approach to landing phase of flight. The Captain briefed me his plans for the approach; including approaching the field VFR. Starting the descent early to 600 ft. was something that I rationalized to myself as being part of the differences to be expected as the Captain previously explained why he was doing so. This resulted in us flying lower to the ocean further out from the runway than we should have been and likely the reason for the GPWS alert upon reaching our rounded minimums after the FAF being referenced.Looking back; even though it was my first time flying into this unique operating environment with an experienced Captain; I should have been more aware of how low we were compared to how far we were from the runway and queried the Captain further on this and call for the approach to be abandoned. During our post-flight debrief I brought up the GPWS alert and asked if this was something we should report and the Captain assured me it was not necessary and dismissed this as saying he could just explain what he was doing to whoever might ask. Going forward I know this should not be the case and reports should be filed if there is any question of their need or warrant.I would welcome additional training for operations into international airports such as ZZZZ which have unique operationalchallenges and potential hazards; especially for relatively inexperienced new first officers like myself."""
Environment - Non Weather Related,At about 40 NM east; northeast of IAH at 10;000 ft. we experienced what we thought to be a 5G event. We first became aware of it by the gear warning horn sounding and 3 red gear lights illuminating above the gear handle. It only lasted a couple of seconds; and then it flickered and sounded again. This time the Captain noticed his radio altimeter rapidly fluttering from around 1000 ft. to 1200 ft. This happened intermittently about 3 to4 times until it stopped. It all happened very quickly and I would say we hadn't traveled more than 5 miles from when it started to when it stopped. The warning horn was so loud and distracting it was hard to hear ATC; or ourselves for that matter.
Ambiguous,Climbing through approximately 2;300 feet MSL we received a 'One-thousand' radio altitude callout. We reported this to Portland Departure and continued our climb. As we passed through approximately 11;600 ft. we received a 'Ten' radio altitude callout at which time our auto-throttles simultaneously disconnected. We reported the event to Seattle Center. I went heads down to report the occurrences to the Company via ACARS and failed to recognize we climbed through FL180 and failed to complete the after take-off checklist; most importantly failed to reset the altimeters to 29.92. We leveled at FL370 for less than a minute with the altimeters set to the departure airport; this put us at approximately FL367. We corrected the altimeters and completed level off at FL370. I got distracted by abnormal radio altitude callouts and auto-throttle disconnect due to 5G interference. I was pre-disposed to think the implementation would be a non-event and was surprised to experience actual interference events. I then rushed to comply with company reporting requirements; which should have waited until the next phase of flight. Suggestions - Delay the company reporting; which causes head down time until level at cruise. I personally needed to maintain better checklist and PM (Pilot Monitoring) discipline during this event.
Aircraft,While on approach about 7 miles out our autothrottles failed. Only reporting because of recent 5G concerns. Flight continued without incident.
Ambiguous,Second time this happened today in 2 separate aircraft at two separate airports. While on final approach just about at the final approach fix; the autothrottles disengaged. Concerned about possible 5G issues.
Environment - Non Weather Related,5G radio interference. At 100 ft. AGL had 'Flare Fail' in heads up display with no flare cue. Altitude call outs were normal. Roll out of 5G telecom. Don't allow 5G telecom near airports!
Aircraft,I was PF (Pilot Flying) and the Captain was PM (Pilot Monitoring). Due to wind shear we briefed a bleeds off takeoff as a threat. I wrote on my SID plate with the highlighter function 'BLEEDS' as a reminder to double check that we got them back on. I confirmed the bleed switch positions were on as we climbed above acceleration height. Climbing out of ZZZ through approximately 11;500 ft. we got a CABIN PRESS warning. We stopped our climb at 12;000 ft. advised ATC and requested a vector to turn us away from the mountains for our descent and were cleared to descend to 7000 ft. I called for the CABIN PRESS warning checklist and took over ATC communication while the captain worked through the checklists and other communication. We received further vectors and continued our descent to return to ZZZ.The APU Bleed was MELd by Maintenance while we were at the gate. Whether related or not it would have been a good idea to pay closer attention to the overall bleed air systems and we may have caught on earlier that something wasn't right.
Aircraft,Departed [Runway] XXL out of ZZZ. Climbing through 7;000 feet for 13;000 feet the right bleed air fail annunciator illuminated with the bleed air valve in the open position. I notified ATC promptly and told them I'd like to stop climb at 13;000 feet and troubleshoot the problem. I ran the appropriate checklist; requested priority handling; and told ATC I would like to return to ZZZ.  They assigned me to land on [Runway] XXL and I landed without further incident and the airplane had no visible damage. Crew was not injured.
Human Factors,During pushback it was realized that we have not received a final dangerous goods report. After pushback; I requested report using miscellaneous DG. We received the report without further issue.
Ambiguous,While at TPA Gate the Captains Radar altimeter fluctuated from approximately -90 ft. to 400 ft. Multiple callouts were observed such as 'retard' and various altitudes. Further; the nav FMA went from armed to captured.The malfunction rectified itself and we safely departed. An information write-up was entered into the logbook and Maintenance checked the radar altimeter in ZZZ. No errors found.I've been flying an aircraft with a radar altimeter for years and never once have I seen a malfunction such as this until the 5G turn on. Coincidence? Probably not.
Environment - Non Weather Related,First Officer spotted a white medium sized drone within a couple hundred feet to the right side of aircraft at 700 feet and [on a] two mile final [to] Runway 22L EWR. Continued normal approach and landing. Reported to ATC; Dispatch; Chief Pilot; and Airport Authority.
Ambiguous,Possible confusion in planning and filing due to cut over to 5G.
Weather,After deicing (TYPE I&IV) application; conducted physical check at gate. Taxied to Runway XXC. Took about 12 minutes. (HOT was 2 hrs). Set icing level to 2. Took off and rotated at Vr. The aircraft started pitch up without normal back pressure and kept pitching up quicker and higher without PF (Pilot Flying) input. Yolk needed to be pushed forward to maintain normal 9 degree pitch. Pitch trim was not responding from both switches on Yolk and STBY. CCAS (Centralized Crew Alerting System) announced icing and selected level 3 at 3000 ft. Hard to maintain altitude and advised ATC to return to ILSXXC. After landing and taxing to[ramp] observed ice accumulation on many aircraft surfaces during post flight. After takeoff rotation; aircraft kept pitching up without PF input.Maintenance suspected that there was ice inside of the pitch trim system. Manually flew aircraft without pitch trim and requested to return to ILSXXC at ZZZ.Should observe all flight control surface movements from outside after deicing application.
Aircraft,After pushback and engine start; we taxied to Runway 30L. All checklists were complete and the aircraft was fully configured for takeoff. The First Officer was flying. Upon setting T/O thrust; we received the T/O configuration warning aural and light. We rejected the takeoff (low speed; maybe 15 kts) and vacated the runway. We reran every checklist from the beginning and found no faults with the airplane configuration. There were no systems faulted. All circuit breakers were in. After talking with Maintenance; we returned to the gate for troubleshooting. We are unsure why we received this warning. Maintenance is still troubleshooting at the time of this report.
Aircraft,Moments after level-off in ZZZZ airspace; the Captain's Primary Flight Display (PFD) lost all data. Only the artificial horizon; amber SPD flag and amber ALT flag remained. The First Officer PFD retained all data and the B autopilot remained engaged. About a minute after the loss of the Captain PFD; all information returned. A complete review of Airspeed Unreliable checklist was completed. About five minutes later; the problem returned for about double the time (2 minutes). We contacted Dispatch and had them bring 737 Maintenance into the crew phone app connection. After a brief discussion; it was determined the aircraft would be grounded at our destination ZZZZ1 and it would be best to return to ZZZ (350 miles away) to have the problem resolved. We landed in ZZZ uneventfully without declaring an emergency (the Captain's PFD was working normally during the descent and arrival). Background information: Two days prior to our departure; the AML noted a ladder had fallen on the Captain window and AOA (Angle Of Attack) vane. The Captain window was replaced.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On departure; [we] received [an] UNABLE RNP EICAS message. [We] believed [the message] to have been directly related to [a] local 5G NOTAM. Due to ATC informing us of [a] previous departure receiving effects of 5G-related malfunctions; [we] strongly believe this to be related to 5G near PDX. 5G near airports is a safety issue affecting automation and navigation.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Due to traffic I was unable to request RNAV visual; on the base to final (which is challenging due to rising terrain) I failed to maintain good situational awareness to the tight turn to final. The gusty wind off the terrain created a lot of my attention to airspeed management and the turn on to see the VASI was difficult due to sun glare. As a result my turn on [final] was four red; I promptly corrected for a normal landing.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Memo indicated that there might be a Thrust Reverser deployment issue as a result of RA (Radar Altimeter) interference because of 5G C-Band deployment. I was PM (Pilot Monitoring) and the FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying). Landing on 35R in DFW everything was normal throughout the approach. When in the final landing phase where the airplane uses the RA to call out 50; 40; 30; 20; 10 - we did not receive the 10 foot call. On landing the FO indicated that the thrust reversers would not deploy. I looked at the EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) display and they were armed. I looked at the switches as well. I took the controls and tried myself and indeed they would not deploy. NO REV Icon was displayed on the EICAS. They behaved exactly as they do when not armed. We exited the runway and I noted that the [Spoiler System] message was still deployed which seemed odd; but upon stopping it went away. I retried the reversers to see if they would unlock and they did and did indicate REV on the EICAS display.I am unsure if 5G C-band is even turned on in the DFW area. So I cannot say for sure this was interference. However; talking to MX (Maintenance) Control when I called them; they said [cellular company] did have their C-band turned on in the DFW area.
Aircraft,This event occurred during Takeoff roll on Runway 27R in ATL. Captain and First Officer received a predictive wind shear warning between 80-100 kts; during calm wind conditions. Other weather conditions/reports did not constitute a wind shear event ie: convective activity; strong winds or microbursts. The ATIS was reporting calm winds and no other aircraft that were taking off or landing reported any type of wind shear activity. We believed this to be an erroneous alert because the message lasted approximately 3 seconds and then extinguished. We continued the takeoff and experienced no wind shear during climb out. We believed the message to be erroneous because the weather conditions were not conducive for wind-shear activity. There could've been a glitch in the system. Also being very new to the aircraft and it's systems could've played a part. During training were only trained on wind shear events during poor weather conditions. We have a flow chart that we use to determine if wind shear conditions exist. There were no conditions that even led us to the chart nor any weather reports or ATC/Pilot reports of any kind of possible wind-shear. The AOM (Aircraft Operating Manual) states we must reject the takeoff for any predictive wind shear message prior to V1. However; due to the fluid nature of the situation we deemed it safer to continue the take-off. Perhaps understanding our own human factors and incorporating guidance found in the AOM in a more timely manner; this could've been prevented.
Aircraft,Advanced the trust levers to 1.5 and got a caution light for ECAM message nav something or other; and then got ecam blue message that it was in test mode and then retard aural. Rejected takeoff at maybe 10 knots and taxied off the Runway by now the aircraft had fixed itself. Did another before takeoff checklist and took off.
Aircraft,Dirty sock smell while descending into ZZZ around 20;000 feet. Mild smell in cockpit but stronger in front of cabin. Smell lasted 4-5 minutes. The plane has another fumes event 6 days prior.
Aircraft,On approach to ZZZZ airport ATC instructed us to Maintain 300 Knots. ATC further instructed us to slow to 250 Knots. After slowing to 250 Knots and just after the chime below 10;000 I receive a call from [Flight Attendant name 1]; informing me of a strong odor I the back of the aircraft. I informed her that we were flying direct to the airport and the safest option was to proceed to the airport and that we would be landing inappropriately 10 minutes. After landing we called the cabin to ascertain the situation.  We were told that the odor had dissipated; so we proceeded to the gate.  After the passengers disembarked; I talked directly to [Flight Attendant 2] who first reported the event. She informed me of a strong odor in the back of the aircraft that caused her minor eye irritation. No other passengers or dead heading crew reported an odor; so it was likely limited to the aft section of the aircraft.
Aircraft,We first noticed engine thrust surging during climb through 12;000 ft. The aircraft wasn't climbing at a normal rate. Then through 15;000 ft.; N1 on the number 1 engine was observed to be surging between approx 56% N1 and the climb target N1. We elected to level off at FL 190 to troubleshoot. This was difficult due to the absence of EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System) messages or abnormalities other than the N1 indications. The engine continued surging on and off for roughly 5 minutes between 56% N1 and the cruise target of about 79% before normalizing. A decision to request priority handling was made and along with our Dispatcher we elected to continue to ZZZ. The flight attendants were briefed on the situation. The rest of the flight was normal until initiating the descent at which time the number 1 engine surged again briefly and normalized again throughout the landing roll. Upon rollout ENG 1 NO DISPATCH EICAS message illuminated. The MX logbook entries were made and MX personnel met the aircraft at the Gate. I'll note that 2 MELs were present on the aircraft; ENG 1 short dispatch and engine 1 bleed system.
Aircraft,Fume event 'dirty sock smell' during descent. At approximately 22;000 ft. we started to smell the typical sock odor. We queried the cabin crew and they reported smelling the odor as well. They also reported the smell as strong and limited to the forward cabin. Odor in the cockpit was light but evident. We did not don masks as the dissipating of the smell started at about 4 minutes. By the time we landed the Captain had a slight headache and light-headedness. Symptoms went away after 30 minutes. FO (First Officer) was pilot flying.
Aircraft,During visual approach into PIT on ILS 32; at 400 feet AGL; tail strike avoid fail and app 2 not avail messages. Continued to safe landing.
Aircraft,Aircraft X; ZZZ; First Officer leg; source on the right side and flaps 3 takeoff Runway XX. On climb out; ZZZ departure; we were assigned a turn and climb (heading 320/15;000 ft.). Climb profile was normal. Flap retraction was occurring normally with the autopilot engaged. After the flap lever was moved to 0 the speed bug remained below the barber pole but the aircraft accelerated. The aircraft then gave the audible 'high speed' alert. Situation was corrected by assuming control; disengaging the autopilot; increasing pitch and reducing thrust. Maintenance and Dispatch were notified through ACARS and a log book entry was made. Situation briefed and priority handling requested due to 0 flap landing. Taxi to Gate and engine shutdown were also uneventful. Inspection by Maintenance revealed no damage to the aircraft.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Arriving into IAH on the DRLLR 5 Runway 26L. Descending on a downwind between 5;000 and 4;000 past ZOEEE; we received a RA flag on the Captain side two separate times. It stayed illuminated for approximately 5 second both times. In the turn to capture the localizer for 26L at approximately 2;500 ft. we got a RA flag on the First Officer side; again; for approx 5 seconds. No other indications or anomalies were noted.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,5G interferences on takeoff.  Lost both GPS's.  Runway 25 Sleek2 SID;  frequency 128.45 at 6;000 ft. got left GPS invalid.   At 11;700 ft. got right GPS invalid.  A 22;000 feet got Right GPS back; at 25;000 feet got left GPS back.   On initial loss contacted ATC; they gave us heading and altitude.  ATC says this has been going on for a while; also heard other planes in same situation
Airspace Structure,Departing DEN as soon as we took off we lost both GPS systems and Transponder 1 and 2.  Systems returned to normal ops at FL260.  ATC informed us numerous aircraft reporting same issue. On arrival into the airport numerous received spurious TCAS alerts.  TCAS was already set to TA only due to reports from preceding aircraft into airport of TCAS alerts.   Turned off TCAS system and landed safely.  Thrust reverser also showed an issue on taxi in; possibly related.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,When we checked in with D01 Approach Controller he informed us of some GPS and ADS-B failures occurring near DIA; presumably from 5G interference.  About the time he cleared us for the ILS 35L Approach (23 miles out); both of our GPS's failed; which I reported to him.  When he switched us to Tower at 20 miles; our transponder failed as well; which I also reported.  We landed without event and the failures corrected themselves on the ground.
Ambiguous,Lost both GPS;and both transponders on approach to Denver. Heard four other aircraft have exact same issue. Also had terr pos [warning] on approach. Systems returned on landing.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Passenger experienced extreme pain and bloody urination on descent (10 minutes to landing) .  Was informed (during descent) passenger had some sort of head injury a few days prior. Notified ATC and had medics standing by.  During descent lost both GPS receivers and then transponder as well.  Aircraft parallel conducted a descending RA while on ILS approach in IMC.  Numerous aircraft were reporting erroneous TCAS and GPWS alerts and had lost GPS.  Did not have RNP capability.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On departure out of DCA the RA flag flashed on the Captain's side for less than a second. It was approximately 8;000 ft. over RGIII intersection. No other abnormalities after that; until on approach into IAH on 26L. It happened 3 more times about a second each time at approximately 3;000 ft. and on the 3rd time; the AP disconnected. We notified ATC per the 5G Pilot Bulletin and hand flew the aircraft to a normal landing. After parking at the Gate; I submitted a maintenance write up and called the FODM and Dispatcher and submitted [a report].
Environment - Non Weather Related,While on the LAWGR3 STAR into DEN; we heard two other aircraft report loss of GPS signal.  Then approximately after YUPEE we lost both of our GPS signals.  Our navigation accuracy slowly degraded; to the point we lost terrain displays while in IMC; which is a little concerning near the Rockies.  We regained the GPS signals outside and perpendicular to the DORRY waypoint on the ILS.  By that short time our RNP accuracy degraded from 0.03 to 0.31.  After regaining GPS coverage outside DORRY it quickly came back to 0.03 accuracy.  When cleared for the approach and inside of DORRY the GPS signal dropped again; but since we were established on the ILS was not a big concern.  Had we been on the RNP we would have been unable to accomplish the approach.  We heard another type aircraft report another anomaly and are guessing that this is a 5G interference issue; but not sure.
Environment - Non Weather Related,About 20nm Northeast of DEN on the LAWGR arrival; 12;000 ft. we received a GPS-R fail; then a GPS-L fail. Confirmed failure on FMC NAV-STATUS page. Then we received the 'xnpndr fail' light on transponder. ATC still had us radar contact. Intercepted LOC on [Runway] 35R. Aircraft symbol showed left of course on NAV page; but right on with LOC/GS with Number 1 and 2 VHF as well as Standby. At about 10;000 ft. MSL we got a TERR POS indication momentarily on NAV display. We landed safely on [Runway] 35R; and during rollout and taxi onto P7; GPS and XPNDR came back on with normal ops.
Weather,Captain briefed de-ice crew on ATR de-ice/anti-ice procedures prior to block-out. Aircraft received Type 1 and Type 4 fluid. Runway XXC was assigned and the taxi time was approximately 12 minutes. Aircraft level 2 ice protection was set during before takeoff procedures. On departure; aircraft rotated at Vr and immediately pitched up to high pitch attitude. Captain was the PF (Pilot Flying) and he commanded full nose down pitch trim to no effect. At approximately 1;500 ft MSL; the aircraft ice detection warning was triggered and IMC conditions were entered. PM (Pilot Monitoring) engaged level 3 ice protection. Crew leveled at 3;000 ft AGL; advised ATC; and requested return to [Runway] XXC. PF was using full strength and both hands to maintain a non-stall attitude. PM pressed against the flight controls with his leg to provide additional bracing to aid the PF in leveling the aircraft. Crew executed ILS XXC to land. Upon return to the ramp; significant ice accumulation was found on the aircraft during post flight.   Uncommanded pitch-up after takeoff without PF input. Suspected ineffective de-ice procedure on T-tail horizontal stabilizer and elevators; likely accumulation inhibited pitch trim functionality. Hand flown return to land on ILS XXCDespite the Captain briefing the de-ice crew on procedures and having an outside observer to confirm adequate deice and anti-ice procedures were performed; the T-tail stabilizer is not able to be checked due to the height above ground. This results in flight crews entrusting that de-ice crews performed to standard on a critical flight control surface. Consistent and vigilant de-ice/anti-ice training and certification must take place for all ground crews on all fleet aircraft.
Environment - Non Weather Related,We were preparing to land in Denver; DEN. Its weather was showing 1/4 SM and VV001. We discussed with [the] FO (First Officer) and decided to brief the CAT II Approach checklist. There was no NOTAM affecting the CAT II approach in DEN about the 5G band interference. We reviewed the daily read and crew memo XX-XX about 5G interference. We tested the RA as the procedure required. RA test passed. We were assigned to descend via Runway 35L transition on [the] NIIXX 3 Arrival. We briefed the approach and we also briefed that in case of any RA interference; we could continue the CAT I Approach minimum if the reported RVR is equal to or greater than 1800 RVR. This was how we were trained in the CAT II training in [the] simulator. If the current visibility permits us to continue and land with CAT I minimum; no need to go missed even if we lost the CAT II compatibility. We received the approach clearance and switched to the Tower frequency. Tower advised us that the current visibility is 1800 RVR. We verified that if we will lose our CAT II compatibility; we will continue to CAT I minimums; which were 200 ft. DA(H). We were about 2 NM away from [the] FAF. I asked for gear down; flaps 22; and CAT II landing check. We checked the CAT II annunciator with the CAT II landing checklist; it was green. Autopilot was ON and armed for the approach. As we crossed the FAF; FO stated; 'Altitude checks; no flags.' We were about 1000 AGL - not sure about the exact altitude - and our RA turned into an amber color. As we previously briefed; I stated to continue the approach with CAT I approach minimums since we have enough visibility for [the] CAT I Approach. We were about 300 - 200 AGL and our autopilot failed when [we] were in IMC. It was very unexpected and I felt distracted. I called the go-around. I felt it was the safest decision. We climbed and maintained 7000 ft. as ATC instructed. There was only an Autopilot Fail message on EICAS as much as I remember. FO and I discussed trying to put the autopilot back on to see [if] it was inoperative or not. It was pretty reliable during the 2 hours flight and our overall experience in [the] Aircraft X autopilot rarely fails. We decided to put the autopilot back on. It was working fine. Eventually; we received vectors back to Runway 35R and landed with [the] ILS CAT I Approach. The situation did not repeat. When we got to the parking position. I tested [the] autopilot again; it was working how it was supposed to. I am not sure why we lost the RA and CAT II compatibility. As a crew; we thought it might be related to 5G band interference. I couldn't understand why our autopilot failed in the critical phase of the flight. Autopilot only failed one time in my more than 3 years of experience in Aircraft X. I can say that it is one of the most reliable systems in our plane. I believe it is a big safety concern to lose autopilot at a very low altitude in IMC. I don't know if somehow there is any connection between autopilot failure; 5G band interference; and RA in amber color; or if it is a different issue. I have discussed what happened in this flight with 5 other pilot friends in the company [and] we couldn't find any logical explanation. I believe it is a big safety concern. I recommend doing some studies and testing inflight to learn about 5G interference and our procedures in every aspect; and training our pilots accordingly. I also recommend CAT II operations be suspended temporarily.
Aircraft,During mid-descent; a strong; sweet; musky odor entered the cockpit. At first it was subtle but continued to get strong enough to make the FO (First Officer) slightly nauseated. We continued the descent and made a normal landing. Once we opened the cockpit door at the gate; the flight attendants commented on how strong the odor was coming out of the cockpit.Reporter suggested the cause was something in the packs?
Environment - Non Weather Related,Flt ABC; MIA-ZZZ. At Gate Both Captain & First Officer RA displayed fluctuations 10 to 2 at Gate and during push back. After engine start; RA both displayed -4; but TCAS FAILED was now displayed on both NAV displays and LNAV went active from white (armed) to active green with lateral course display on both PFD's. Aircraft taken out of service by Maintenance. ASAP Filed. Maintenance history on aircraft instruments. Needs to include all aircraft instrument malfunctions and issues with 5g interference/activation.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Operating to BOS; we experienced a radar altimeter anomaly in cruise at FL350. This occurred approximately 20nm east of HRRSH intersection while navigating from HRRSH direct to BUF. Twice; in quick succession; both radar altimeters scanned up and down; along with an aural '500' call from the GPWS system. There was no traffic in proximity to our aircraft on TCAS at this time.In 15 years I've not seen this occur before; and I suspect it to be possible 5G interference and should be looked into further.
Environment - Non Weather Related,During the initial climb out of DEN shortly after take off (once the ECAMS were uninhabited) we got an alert message saying ADSB 1 and ADSB 2 were faulted. We chose to disregard the messages until we were at a safer altitude where we could address them. Once the after take off checklist was completed I addressed the messages. Passing about 10;000 ft. the problem disappeared. The only time I have seen an ADSB problem is when the GPS was jammed or faulted. I'm not sure if this has something to do with the roll out of 5G. We didn't have any problems the rest of the flight.
Ambiguous,After takeoff and through about 8;300 feet both GPS stopped receiving/or jammed signal. All associated equipment that uses GPS stopped functioning. (i.e. Ads-b.) ANP reverted to no GPS accuracy and map shift occurred. We remained in the RNP area for the departure; but just by a couple of; 0.1 nautical miles. GPS signal returned through 16;000 feet. ATC was advised.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,On departure on the SLEEK 2 RNAV Departure approximately at 7;000 feet turning toward KIDNG intersection lost GPS-L and then GPS-R momentarily.  Not sure what had caused it (maybe 5G).  Denver Departure was asking several questions to other aircraft about the loss of GPS.  After a few seconds GPS was functioning appropriately without any issues on the flight to ZZZ1.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,While descending into DEN on the CLASH4 STAR near JAAAM intersection at 13;000 ft.; we received a GPS-L Invalid message followed by a GPS-R Invalid message. We noted the FMC was not receiving a GPS signal. We reported the anomaly to Dispatch and ATC who advised us that many other aircraft were encountering similar GPS issues. We continued VMC to landing. After landing I noted my iPad was not receiving a GPS position as well. While taxiing to the gate; both my iPad and the aircraft reacquired a GPS signal.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,After checking in with Denver Approach;  we were given a descend from 13;000 to 11;000 feet.  As we began the descent;  we received a GPS Primary Lost message on the navigation display and the GPS accuracy went from HIGH to LOW.  We also received the alert message NAV ADS-B RPTG 1 (and 2) FAULT.  Turning onto the final approach course;  the GPS accuracy returned to HIGH; but the ADS-B Fault periodically returned.  We landed the aircraft without any other issues.  Denver stated that it may have something to do with the 5G network.
Aircraft,'GPS invalid' appeared on initial climbout. GPSs returned at 17;000 ft.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,During descent the aircraft experienced a loss of both ADS-B receiving 1 & 2 and a temporary Terrain display to standby on our NAV display. Loss was accompanied by a Class 2 message alerts which we began to run. Since the message alert requires determining the state of the transponder; I queried the ATC Controller as to the status of our transponder. He stated 'Everything is fine; 5G interference in the vicinity of DEN was reported'. We completed the approach.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,According to ATC 5G interference is causing GPS and ADS-B anomalies around DEN.  We lost GPS-L; GPS-R; and had an XPNDR FAIL light immediately after takeoff.  GPS-L returned and XPNDER FAIL extinguished after passing FL250 at 90 nautical miles east of DEN.  GPS-R returned after passing FL260 at 103 nautical miles east of DEN.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On descent on the TBARR 3 descending through 13;000 ft we received several spurious ADSB 1 and 2 faults.  Then following these faults we got GPS 1 and 2 faults as well.  Both faults were spurious and continued all the way through descent and approach to the ground.  Maintenance feels that this is a result of the 5G implementation even though we are told that DEN is not affected by 5G.
Airspace Structure,Due to continued 5G interference in the DEN area we lost GPS-L; GPS-R; and got an XPNDER FAIL light turning over FFFAT on the LAWGR 3 arrival.  Later after capturing the localizer to 35R we could see the depicted path on the navigation display was offset from the actual localizer final approach course.  No further issue or anomaly was experienced.  Systems returned to normal by the time we parked at the gate.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On the FLATI3 arrival [Runway] 35R transition into DEN we received NAV ADS-B RPTG 1 and NAV ADS-B RPTG 2 FAULT message alerts descending thru 11;500 ft between FFFAT & DOGGG waypoints. We had been in and out of DEN multiple times this day and received similar alerts and assumed it was due to 5G. We reported the issue to DEN Approach and submitted a report.
Airspace Structure,Climbing out of DEN we lost our GPS and did not get it back the entire flight. Navigation accuracy stayed high enough that the flight was not affected with the exception of we could not do RNAV approaches. GPS was lost on our IPAD apps also.
Airspace Structure,On approach to [Runway] 34R at DEN and descending below 10;000; we had a total lost of our GPS signal.  We did not get it back the entire approach and landing. We notified ATC. We were on vectors to the ILS so it did not affect our flight. DEN ATC knew about the issue and were not issuing any clearances for RNAV approaches. Multiple aircraft were having the same issue. We also had an ADS-B reporting fault at the same time.
Airspace Structure,During RNAV GPS approach Runway 27R to Chicago; aircraft had erroneous path indication showing almost full scale below. Acquired airport visually and flew below VNAV path to require proper glide path.  And we flown aircraft using auto pilot in the VNAV; I missed approach would've been required.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Inbound DEN had failure of ADSB and GPS.
Ambiguous,Aircraft X on arrival from ZZZ-DEN flying the ZZZZZ RNAV Arrival on XXR transition but then updated to a visual approach for Runway XXL.  ATIS information warned of ADS-B and GPS issues around DEN airport.  Approximately 10nm North of ZZZZZ1 at approx 15;000 feet got 'GPS Primary Lost' FMGC indications for both Captain and First Officer as well as loss of EFB location information.  Shortly thereafter got NAV ADS-B FAULT Channel 1 and Channel 2 and NAV TCAS FAULT alert message.  After about 30-45 seconds GPS PRIMARY was restored and alert messages cleared on their own.  30-45 seconds later the pattern repeated.  Visual with the airfield I elected to disengage autoflight and auto thrust to fly manually.  The alert message pattern continued for 3-4 cycles until Captain opted to select 'EMER CANCEL' on the alert message system to stop the distraction of multiple repeating alert messages.  Multiple aircraft on DEN Approach radio frequencies reported similar issues in the general area.  It was enough that DEN Approach Controller began broadcasting a warning to all aircraft on his frequency to expect ADS-B and GPS interference problems.After landing the Capt and I informed maintenance at the gate but did not submit a write-up.  We agreed that with so many other aircraft in the area reporting the same issues on approach frequencies and the ATIS warning this was almost certainly an airspace/airport problem and not an aircraft system problem. As of this morning DEN ATIS reports 'GPS; TRANSPONDER; ADS-B ANOMALIES REPORTED IN THE DENVER AREA.' [Our location was] 10nm North of ZZZZZ1 on ZZZZZ RNAV Arrival.
Ambiguous,The incident occurred taxing out to Runway 28R from our gate for takeoff at FLL (Ramp Control). During pre-flight planning the crew discussed the full sequence of events for the flight and noted that the aircraft was not parked in one of the primary gates listed on the company pages. As a result; considering the proximity of the runway to the gate the crew agreed it would be best to start both engines for taxi. This was again mentioned during the 'Threats' portion of the brief and discussed by the crew that we would complete the 'Before Takeoff' checklist prior to leaving the ramp as a mitigation - in this case due to both the proximity to the runway and there seemed to be very few aircraft operating at the time leading to an expectation there would be no delays for departure.Everything from the brief through the 'Before Push' checklist was uneventful. Once ready; the FO called Ramp Control for push from the gate and received clearance for 'Spot 0.' This spot is not displayed on either the Jeppsen 10-9 Chart or company taxi page; but was quickly located by the crew on the 10-9B page. The Captain relayed the clearance to ground handling personnel and the aircraft was pushed back uneventfully. As briefed; both engines were started and the 'After Start' checklist was completed. The 'Before Takeoff' checklist was started and the Captain observed some ground vehicles and ground personnel waiting for us to move; so we stopped the checklist and called Ramp Control requesting to move forward and allow all of those waiting to be released. Ramp instructed us to 'proceed on Taxiway Bravo and hold short of [Taxiway] B12' - this clearance was read back as instructed. The FO and Captain subsequently cleared our respective sides of the aircraft and commenced an immediate left turn onto; as it later became apparent; Taxiway Tango holding short of [Taxiway] B12. Based on debrief discussion; both the Captain and FO stated that we believed we were correctly following directions and we completed the 'Before Takeoff' checklist (including 'Final Items'); thereby leading to the FO going heads down once established on the taxiway.Based on our proximity to the runway and ATIS information stating 'FLL Tower' and 'FLL Ground' operations were conducted on frequency 119.3; we checked in initially with FLL Tower and we were instructed to switch back to FLL Ground on 121.4 (a new ATIS had just became active re-establishing separation of frequencies). As we checked in with FLL Ground we were instructed to 'taxi via Taxiway Bravo to Runway 28R.' The FO switched back to the company taxi page from the 10-9B page on Jeppesen and realized we were on Taxiway Tango - immediately reporting the error to the Captain. We agreed on the error and then reported our position to FLL Ground and requested a switch back to Ramp in order to correct the issue. Upon checking in with Ramp we were instructed to 'proceed on Taxiway Tango to T2; then switch back to FLL Ground' - all remaining operations occurred without incident.During debrief the FO and Captain recounted the sequence of events and noted that we both observed the taxiway sign ahead of 'Spot 0;' perceiving that it depicted Taxiway Bravo as being immediately to our left. Neither the Captain or FO recalled any sign for Taxiway Tango at that position. Reviewing each Jeppesen depiction it is clear that we needed to taxi straight ahead before making the left turn from 'Spot 0' - based on our perception at the time when calling for taxi this did not seem as apparent using visual cues.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Descending through 11;000 ft. had NAV ADS-B RPTG 1 and 2 Fault.  Also lost GPS PRIMARY navigation.  Saw no real degradation in navigation systems.  Landed normally out of an ILS approach.  Numerous aircraft reported having the same issue descending into Denver.
Ambiguous,Arriving in Denver on LAWGR arrival; received vectors for visual 16L. Passing 10;000 ft. GPS L FAIL message displayed for a few seconds. On the approach at 1;500 ft.; GPS FAIL L GPS FAIL R appeared. Transponder displayed a FAIL light and captains clock went blank. IPAD also lost location services. This remained throughout landing and taxi. We sent in a report and contacted Maintenance.
Ambiguous,During the descent into DEN on the NIIXX 3 RNAV arrival we received ECAM messages for the loss of ADSB-1 and 2 RPTNG passing through approximately 13;500 feet in the vicinity of BSTON waypoint.  While continuing our descent we lost GPS-1 signal at about 11;500 feet and then GPS-2 signal at about 7;500 feet.  We assume that this was due to 5G interference.  We reported these items to DEN Approach and submitted the appropriate error maintenance codes.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,Upon STAR initiation (Nixxes) into DEN landing north; ATC advised a 5G event at DEN.  At 10;000 feet on Localizer to 35L; ECAM intermittently dinged and displayed ADS-B 1&2 Reporting Failure. Cleared ECAM and emergency cancelled the repetitive nuisance messages. Additionally; received a GPS Lost message on FMC at 8;000 feet.  Continued CAT 1 ILS to landing uneventfully.  Notified maintenance of ADS-B system failure.  Maintenance informed me that that was the third such report of ADS-B failure in the last 15 minutes.
Ambiguous,Descending on FLATI arrival into DEN airport approx 25 nm northwest; got ADS-B RPTG 1/2 Fault caution [message] and associated GPS primary lost on NAV display. No degradation in navigation. Captain hand flew ILS approach to Runway 35L; no issues with radar altimeter.
Environment - Non Weather Related,As we prepared for pushback from DEN; we received a message from Dispatch that numerous aircraft departing DEN were losing their GPS; possibly due to interference from the 5G signals.  We discussed the possibility of losing our GPS on our departure.  During our initial climbout at 800 feet AGL; we received an EICAS message indicating that we lost our ADS-B out capabilities.   I reported this to ATC; and we were told by ATC; that numerous aircraft had been experiencing various navigation/Communication failures which appeared to be due to interference of the new 5G signals.  These failures included loss of GPS; Loss of ADS-B; and loss of transponder. In our case; we only had a loss of the ADS-B out. signal. By FL180 everything returned to normal operations.  We had no further issues with any of our communication and or navigation equipment for the rest of the flight.  We notified Dispatch of our issues while departing DEN.  We did not write up the ADS-B as an ELB; as the problem seemed related to the 5G signal and then went away as we gained more altitude on the climb.
Ambiguous,We were on final GNAV RNP Z 02L approach into SNA; about 2 miles south of the field. Captain was flying and I was Monitoring. We were in VMC and the Captain was hand flying the aircraft. At about 600 ft.; AGL I received an amber RA flag in my RadAlt indicating my RadAlt had failed. I immediately crosschecked with the Captain and his was still indicating correctly. Just above 500 ft. I started receiving my RadAlt indications again. I had no other indication issues until touchdown. Touchdown was uneventful with all systems working correctly.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Denver Center warned all aircraft entering their sector that they had been experiencing 5G interference. While descending on the SSKII 3 Arrival; we had an ECAM showing NAV ADS-B 1 and 2 faults. This message disappeared and reappeared several times. About 5 minutes later we lost both GPS 1 and 2. We never recovered the GPS's. During a later descent; the aircraft leveled at BOENG intersection at 9;200 feet with a green ALT CONST FMA. The published altitude was 9;000 feet.  According to ATC; several other aircraft had also reported issues with their ADS-B and GPS systems.
Ambiguous,On final approach in IMC; ILS 35L at DEN; XA:45 MST. After configuring the airplane for final approach; we had an alert message with associated Master Caution [warning]. The alert message was for NAV ADS-B RPTG 1 Fault. It came on and off several times. We complied with the QRH procedure and switched the Transponder to position 2. It failed several more times with a Master Caution. Several aircraft on approach were reporting the same issue and ATC said that had been hearing about it all day with no explanation.
Ambiguous,Departing from DIA we lost Left GPS taxiing out.  On climb out we lost both GPS and had transponder failure.  Alerted ATC and they knew about it; said everyone was having the same issue and it would go away 30 miles east of Denver.  We eventually got both GPS back and transponder fail went away 60nm east if Denver climbing through FL260.   Worked fine rest of the flight. Heard numerous aircraft having the same issue near Denver.  Alerted Dispatch via ACARS that it might be a 5G interference issue but they said 5G wasn't activated in DEN yet; so I have no idea what's causing the issues there then but it's widespread and hitting all the aircraft.
Ambiguous,Very shortly after departing DEN on the EMMYS8 SID we received a GPS-L Invalid message followed by a GPS-R Invalid message. I also noted a transponder fail light illuminated. We advised ATC of our problem. ATC advised us they were not receiving our ADS-B info and many other aircraft were encountering similar GPS issues. About 40 miles east of DEN near EMMYS intersection; the aircraft reacquired a GPS signal. We advised dispatch and continued uneventfully to ZZZ with all systems normal for the duration of the flight.
Ambiguous,Departed Runway 25 at DEN. Passing 8;000ft; lost ADSB reporting and GPS NAV. Reported to ATC and continued assigned SID. GPS was recovered at 16;500 ft in addition to ADSB reporting. Continued flight and sent a [maintenance] code.
Ambiguous,Conducting ILS 35L in DEN we lost both GPS receivers; had a map shift; and lost transponder.  The aircraft was established on the ILS using the ILS signal and autopilot on.  The aircraft responded normally as did the autopilot. The flight landed uneventfully.  Taxiing in GPS receivers and transponder recovered and were in a normal state of operation.
Ambiguous,Upon arrival [into] DEN at 15;000 ft. we lost both GPS signals and transponder fail illuminated.  After notifying ATC they confirmed they had our transponder and that they were aware of the GPS failure.
Ambiguous,Both ADS-B receivers failed on base leg. Appeared to resume normal operations on final.
Ambiguous,Approx 400 feet AGL [we received] ECAM for dual ADS-B failure 'ADS-B RPTG 1/2 fault'. This followed [at] 800 feet [by] GPS lost/failure shortly after. ATC advised; per NOTAM we understood DEN has issues. Dispatch notification after level off.
Ambiguous,Shortly after takeoff from Runway 34L we got an ATC Fault EICAS message. Tried to switch transponder from 2 to 1 but that did not resolve the EICAS message. At about 1;500 ft. AGL we got a TERR POS EICAS message. When we asked Departure Control if they saw any issues with our transponder they responded that they did not but they were suspecting 5G interference because many aircraft were reporting anomalies like ours. Both the ATC Fault and TERR POS EICAS messages went away after we climbed above FL 220.
Ambiguous,After takeoff from Runway 34L on the DDRTH 1 departure at approximately 6;800 ft we received NAV ADS-B RPTG 1 and NAV ADS-B 2 FAULT ECAMs. We assume this was due to 5G. We reported to DEN Departure and submitted a report.
Ambiguous,On the arrival into Denver at 12;200 ft. in the vicinity of KARVE intersection lost ADSB reporting. ADSB reporting fault 1 and 2 ECAM. Over DYMON at 8;200 ft. lost GPS on all three systems. Reported loss to ATC and continued the approach. Accomplished maintenance write up.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On Departure off of Runway 17R in DFW on the AKUNA9 SID; the FO (First Officer) side Radar Altimeter (RA) displayed a flag; and the Captain side RA displayed roughly 200-300 ft. higher than the FO side. This flag was displayed for approximately 5-10 seconds; and then resumed as normal. The first indication of an anomaly occurred around 2;000 ft. MSL; or 1;500 AGL. Possible 5G interference departing DFW. Delay implementation of 5G service until all issues with radar altimeters and transport category aircraft have been dealt with.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On an empty ferry flight DEN-ZZZ; we were climbing to 11;000 ft. as our final cruise altitude. With no passengers the aircraft was climbing about 2;500 FPM through 10;000 ft. Around that same time the ADSB Fail light illuminated; we were aware that there had been reported GPS failures in the area and we got distracted when the light illuminated. We made the 1;000 ft. to go call out but by the time we looked back at the flight instruments we were passing 11;000 ft. and I was hand flying. I immediately began to correct and level off; we reached 11;500 ft. before returning to our assigned altitude of 11;000 ft.The entire time the ADSB fail message was illuminated; we were in heading mode. The ADSB FAIL light was only illuminated for a few seconds.There were no GPS deviations only a brief altitude deviation. The flight continued successfully with no other deviations and the GPS was operational the rest of the flight.When DEN and ZZZ are departing and landing south this is a very short flight. We were busy with our normal flight duties and a bit rushed. When the ADSB FAIL light illuminated I got distracted. The empty airplane had a much higher climb [rate] than normal. Both these things combined caused a slight altitude deviation.[I should] prioritize the state of the aircraft over the brief GPS outage especially in a high AOV [Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service] area. As pilot flying I should have utilized automation rather than hand flying in times of high work load to prevent deviation and reduce workload.
Human Factors,Abeam the airport level at 8000 ft.; the Captain prompted me to start slowing; I activated the approach speeds in preparation for configuration and descent. I added a last second briefing item about configurations and we got a descent clearance in the middle of that briefing. I misunderstood the descent clearance as 4000 ft.; instead of 5000; I consequently set 4000 in the altitude selector. We got a vector during the descent as expected; we got ICE Speeds as we broke out of the overcast; about 5000 ft. and the Captain was entering those and cleaning up the FMS for the approach. I was heads-up and saw the city lights so I had no cause for concern. At 4500 ft. ATC gave us an ALT Alert; low altitude; climb 5000. I used the TCS (Touch Control Steering) button to override the automation and asked the captain to set 5000 ft. and we climbed back up. There was no GPWS alert and the ground was in visual reference. The rest of the approach proceeded without incident. As the aircraft was slowing I remembered the that I had not briefed when I would call for 'gear down/flap 3; and when I would be fully configured for landing; due to the non-standard RA readings to [Runway] XXR - where the TDZE is elevated from the terrain west of the threshold. I asked the Captain to verify my math and confirm if by 4300 ft. (1500AFE) would be gear-down/f3 altitude; which is notably before to FAF ZZZZZ; and landing config just after ZZZZZ. A similar briefing as I would give in ZZZ1; but I had forgotten to do this in the original briefing. As the Captain was verifying this for me we got a descent clearance; 'descend 5000'; that I heard at the time as 'descend 4000'. We began descending and I was expecting a vector any moment. We were leaving 8000 ft. and we were NW of ZZZ; and the vector would take us away from terrain; so in the task saturation of entering ice speeds at the same time as getting a vector; I failed to recognize that the altitude I had set was 4000 and the final approach altitude was actually 4100. That would usually make me question what I thought I heard. We broke out of the clouds it was VMC and I had even less concern because our vector was taking us inside of ZZZZZ1. I am pretty sure that when I was asking the Captain earlier to double check the configuration altitudes; we both got 4000 stuck in our heads; because that was about where the configs would be taking place. Seeing the city and having the tasks completed helped me relax; but I still did not catch that we had set the selector 100 ft. lower than the final segment altitude; which would usually be a red-flag that I had misunderstood something and need double check. The Tower alerted us that we were low and we promptly corrected as the Captain set 5000 ft. and I TCS'd to initiate the climb. Adding somewhat complex briefings during a final segment of STAR to approach caused misunderstanding of the clearance and at the same time degraded my situational awareness of clues that would alert to a misunderstanding. As so often does; it went from a gradual deceleration for configuration; to everything happening at once; distracting us with ice speeds; vectors and FMS management; especially the PM (Pilot Monitoring) can become severely task saturated in an instant. Even though I was intending to cover the late addition to the briefing while things were still relatively quiet; I distracted the captain and myself by doing so at that time. If I recognize that I have omitted something from the briefing; I should transfer controls; and abbreviate the points I need to address. At the [time] I brought it up; I was trying to abbreviate it and I thought we had sufficient time; which quickly changed. Verifying altitudes that are assigned with charted altitudes as a cross-reference needs to become a habit of mine; so that I don't ever set an altitude 100 ft. lower than FAF altitude again.
Procedure,We had landed Runway 28. Crossed 27L and was holding short of 27R; note it being the long Runway in Atlanta. It was a very busy day; especially with deicing. After a plane was cleared for takeoff on 27R; it lifted off somewhere halfway down the Runway or before. Before the plane was barely off the ground; still not far down the Runway; were cleared to cross at intersection T. I read it back; scanned the Runway and noticed the plane taking off had just lifted off; 100-200 ft.; maybe; and was still not even close to our intersection; maybe S or U intersection; taking off west. I hit the breaks after we passed the hold short line seeing this. The captain inquired and I said 'it hasn't crossed yet'. After what felt like 5-7 seconds it passed and we continued without incident. In the moment I believed this compromised safety and possibly was a Runway incursion because the plane taking off had not passed us yet. I believe the pace Atlanta needed to keep up with to get planes moving caused this premature clearance to cross. They were telling planes to read back call signs only; which I didn't hear until after the clearance was given. I would probably scan before starting aircraft movement and keep my attention on the radio to keep better situational awareness.
Procedure,During departure taxi at night to 36C in CLT; the taxi surfaces were wet with puddles of water. The glare from the surrounding lights on the water made it difficult to see taxi lines and marking so I taxied especially slow. The Ramp Controller had us holding at spot X for inbound traffic. Then Ramp Control instructed us continue our taxi to spot Y South. The First Officer requested taxi clearance on ground control frequency. The Ground Controller gave us the instructions as follows: 'Aircraft X taxi to Runway 36C via Taxiway Golf; Runway 23; hold short of Taxiway Bravo; contract Ground on 121.8.' The First Officer read the instructions back to the Ground Controller precisely. As I approach Taxiway G; I scanned Runway 23 to my left. The area in that direction was very dark and I did not see any airplanes or airplane lights to indicate that there was another airplane coming from left to right. When I looked in the easterly direction I could see the FBO lights on the east side of the Airport and with that backdrop area looked clear of traffic. I took my attention back to the Taxiway in front of us to enter the center of Taxiway G. I looked right to clear the direction I wanted to turn. As our airplane's nose was abeam the edge of the entry of Runway 23; I looked left again and barely made out Aircraft Y nose. At the same time I saw the airplane; they flashed the light on the nose wheel on and off. I slammed on the brakes and stopped in time not entering the Runway. The Aircraft Y made no attempt to stop and as the airplane passed us at a good rate of speed and it turned off the light on the nose wheel. Also I did not see navigation lights on the wings. The airplane was very dark with not even the logo light on. I set the parking brake and had to take a few minutes to decide if we [were] fine to continue. I told the First Officer to let Ground Control know we were stopped on Taxiway Golf. The Ground Controller was unaware of the issue as he was busy giving airplanes behind us taxi instructions. Once we were able to get a turn on the frequency the First Officer told him we need a minute on Taxiway G. When the Controller asked the reason; I took the radio call and advised him we almost entered Runway 23 when the Aircraft Y on Runway 23 almost abeam Taxiway Golf. He apologized for the mistake and I told him we needed a few more minutes. I needed a few minutes to discuss the event with the First Officer and check on the flight attendants. The First Officer and I discussed that the Aircraft Y probably landed on Runway 36R at approximately XA:45z and received taxi instructions before we were on the frequency. The airplane must of been on Taxiway Charlie or Romeo entering Runway 23 when I looked in that direction the first time. Without the Taxiway light there was very little chance of seeing the airplane in the dark and all the back ground lights obscuring a single navigation light. When we checked on to the ground control frequency I did not hear the Controller speak to a Company X airplane. The Controller interrupted our discussion and the time I needed to speak to the flight attendants. I instructed the First Officer to tell him we needed a few more minutes. I contacted the flight attendants and check on the cabin. They had already called 'secure for takeoff' so they said everything was fine. Afterwards; I told the First Officer to let Ground know we were ready to continue the taxi. We were given the same taxi instructions and the Controller apologized again. On the second ground control frequency I asked if he could get any information on the Aircraft Y and he came back with no information on the airplane as it was an inbound flight. We completed the taxi and prepared for takeoff. The flight was completed without further incident.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Boarded flight and Captain prior to door closure said they were having issues because of 5G networking; asked all passengers to turn their phones to airplane mode and WI Fi. We pushed back from gate; more PA from Captain made with same issue FA (Flight Attendant) walked through cabin to ask passengers to turn their phones to airplane mode; but had no way of enforcing this and from my seat I saw 2 passengers scrolling through their facebook accounts and  watching facebook videos. Captain final came on PA and said we would have to return to the gate and deplane and have Maintenance take a look at aircraft systems; which is what we did we were told that we did not have contracted Maintenance at ZZZ for this aircraft and we took approximately 2 1/2 delay before we were on our way again. Wanted this event to be brought forward and I believe we will see more issues concerning the 5G and passengers putting their phones on Airplane mode.
Aircraft,We had just prepared the cabin for landing when we all got a call from the flight deck. I was FA (Flight Attendant) 04 on a 737 so my jumpseat does not have a phone. FA 02 told me that the FO (First Officer) was feeling nauseous and requested a sick bag. FA 01 and FA 03 secured a cart up front and passed an empty trash bag up to the flight deck. The flight deck asked if we could smell any strong odors in the FWD cabin; LAV; or Galley. All four of us (FAs) went to the FWD lab and galley to smell check; it smelled like a strong air freshener to me. FA 02 admitted that she got light headed after smelling the strange smell and we then went to our jumpseats. After landing and the flight deck door being opened; FA 01 and FA 03 say that they could smell the strong musty odor that the pilots were complaining about. The pilots had to open the windows in the flight deck once parked at the gate to air out the strong smell. I did not have any signs of discomfort or injury except for pain in my right arm and slight twitch of my right eye.
Ambiguous,At night in MIA; after [a] rainstorm; taxiing in from landing on Runway 9. Clearance after crossing Runway 30 on Taxiway V; was 'V P HH hold short Y1.' As I approached [the Taxiway] P and Y intersection I observed an aircraft taxiing south on [Taxiway] HH approaching the Y2 intersection. At this moment I mistakenly thought the approaching aircraft was on [Taxiway] JJ; and I turned northbound on Taxiway Y thinking it was HH. As soon as I turned; I realized my mistake and stopped the aircraft short of [Taxiway] Y2. The approaching aircraft had stopped on HH; also short of Y2. I informed ground of my mistake and was given clearance to continue north on [Taxiway] Y and to transition to HH on Y2. The southbound aircraft continued clearance to transition to Y at Y2.In hindsight; that particular intersection area is an unlit wide open concrete pad that has many taxiways merging in a small area with many taxiway signs. I do believe in these particular intersections; it would be helpful to have the taxiway identifier painted on the tarmac with the lead in lines; much like the spot markings approaching airport gates. However; I could have prevented this situation; and will avoid repeating this in the future by simply stopping the aircraft when any doubt arises.
Aircraft,The flight began as a ferry flight on an aircraft that needed finishing rudder repairs in ZZZ. It had been sitting in ZZZ1 for about 10 days before we flew it. The incident was not related to the rudder or control system in any manner. The flight was uneventful from startup through takeoff. On departure climb out we smelt a fume smell similar to that of exhaust smell taxiing behind a 737 with a metal/oil smell similar to a mechanics shop. It was mild at first; becoming worse and then better again all within a matter of minutes. By 10;000 ft. and a few minutes into the flight the smell was mostly gone; though we were unsure if it was because it was gone or if we'd just gotten used to it. We informed dispatch and asked if the COMAT (Company Material) we had in the fwd cargo contained any oil or liquids that could have spilled and recirculated. The FO (First Officer) and I also took turns walking through the aircraft feeling the floor and sniffing around for any evidence of a worsening or threatening condition. From then on through cruise and beginning our descent were all uneventful.We took the time in cruise to debrief what had occurred and discuss what we'd do if it returned. Our consensus was that our checklist doesn't give leeway into; 'how bad is the smell' or 'what is the smell'. Rather it simply states if we have fumes of any kind we don oxygen; QRC which leads to QRH declare and land at nearest suitable. Our plan was after this was simple; if it comes back we go to ZZZ2 or ZZZ; whichever is closer. Advised ATC on descent somewhere in the mid 20s. Prior to this we'd been in a stable (speed/power/rate) descent for 7 or 8 thousand ft. (FL340 - FL20 something). Seemingly out of nowhere the smell returned and was significantly more potent than the first time around. Per our debrief we did our memory items; ran the QRC; and the FO ran the QRH and advised ATC with intentions to go to ZZZ2 (50NM off our right wing) while I executed the divert; set up the box; notified dispatch and briefed the visual approach. We stopped off the runway upon landing to have the trucks inspect the aircraft prior to heading to our maintenance hangar. All remaining or unmentioned phases were uneventful. My final thoughts revolve are just what smell we had. Multiple members of company asked if it was a 'dirty sock smell'. I would not at all characterize what we experienced as anything like that. And coming from a long time hockey player I'm certainly familiar with such atrocious smells! My background also puts me with limited shop experience and a knowledge of the smell of burnt rubber; trans; hydraulic and oil fluids. This was closer to the smell of a 737 exhaust when taxing too close behind them than any other smell I can think of. If I had to liken it to any oil I'd say it was closest to the smell of fresh trans fluid that you'd put in a trans case. It was pungent; but no sock I've come across compares. One of the discussions I had with Management after this situation was in regards to the fumes QRC and this 'dirty sock smell'. Long story short I was informed that this was most likely not an issue and we could have continued. This was absolutely not said in a way that implied what we did as being wrong in anyway. It was more of a 'just so you know to add to your toolbox' type conversation. I was also informed of the potential intent on removing fumes from the QRC and initially I agreed. Heck we just had it on departure and didn't react appropriately. According to our manuals the reaction is simple; 'smell something?' If yes QRC land. We didn't do that. However; after thinking about this topic extensively since then and reviewing some reading material supplied to me by the union I believe what we have now is the best option. Furthermore; I think we should take it more seriously. Consider this; 10 times out of 10 if you smell something and follow the steps we have I am confident you will be safe on the ground to talk about your situation.On the other hand; if you instead decide to figure out what your smelling; how bad the smell is; or if it's a threat; the outcome could quickly become catastrophic if the odor is a serious threat. I'm also confident that there are plenty of dangerous odors that I have never smelled before and some that might not seem dangerous at first discovery. I'm happy with the results of this event. I'm here telling you about it. I'd urge you to think carefully before allowing people to decide which smells are dangerous and which aren't. The safest route is; without any doubt; to some your mask and get the plane to the pavement. A last note; with now near 3;000 hours in this aircraft and 100's if not thousands of takeoffs and landings I have never once smelled anything like this onboard this aircraft or any other I've flown in as a passenger or operator.
Aircraft,The Captain and I were operating a Maintenance Ferry from ZZZ-ZZZ1. The Captain was PF (Pilot Flying) and I was PM (Pilot Monitoring). The plane had been sitting in ZZZ for 12 days and undergoing Maintenance due to a [another airliner] hitting the [aircraft's] rudder with its wingtip while taxiing by it. Shortly after takeoff while climbing out of ZZZ; the Captain and I started to smell a strong odor of what we can best describe as oil or the smell of an auto body shop. It smelled like it would when taxiing behind another airplane and that airplanes exhaust gets into our air circulation; however; it was more of an oil like smell and less like fuel. I pushed in the EICAS FULL button to take a look at the oil temperature; oil pressure; and engine vibration indications. Everything seemed normal on the EICAS and we didn't notice any issues with the engine. Above 10;000 ft.; the Captain asked me to take controls and radios while he goes back to the cabin to check if everything is in order. While he was investigating the cabin; I pulled up the ECS Synoptic Page and noticed that the Engine 2 bleed pressure was fluctuating quite rapidly between 0 and roughly 55 PSI while the Engine 1 bleed pressure remained stable at about 35 PSI.When the Captain returned to the flight deck; I brought the fluctuating Engine 2 bleed pressure to his attention. He told me he didn't see anything unusual in the cabin. He took controls and radios while I went to investigate the cabin as well. Before doing so; Engine 2 bleed pressure stabilized to about 35 PSI consistent with Engine 1 bleed pressure. I came to the same conclusion that there was nothing unusual in the cabin. We messaged Dispatch to let them know what we smelled. The Captain and I were discussing possible causes of the odor and initiated a discussion if in hindsight we should've just run the Smoke; Fire; Fumes non normal procedure despite the fact that the odor went away fairly quickly after we noticed it. We both agreed that fumes can negatively affect us and/or incapacitate us without us realizing even if we thought the smell was gone. On the other hand we discussed the implications of prematurely [requesting priority handling]. We came to the conclusion that in the future; it is always best to immediately don the oxygen masks and run the procedure to preserve our health and safety of flight as opposed to the alternative. We discussed how the Smoke; Fire; Fumes procedure doesn't provide guidance on what qualifies as fumes and whether how long it lasts or whether or not it dissipates actually matters when making the decision to run the procedure. We both felt this was a strong oily odor that neither of us had experienced in our careers and in our time flying the aircraft.During an established stable power; stable speed descent into ZZZ1; the smell came back. However; this time it was significantly stronger. We both immediately executed memory items: donned our oxygen masks and established communication. We ran the Smoke; Fire; Fumes QRC and QRH; [we requested priority handling]; and diverted to ZZZ2. I requested ZZZ2 Approach to have the airport roll the [AARF] trucks to inspect our plane after we landed. We landed safely on Runway XXC in ZZZ2 while still wearing our oxygen masks. We had the [airport support] vehicles inspect our airplane and they said everything was normal. At this point we removed our oxygen but kept them handy in case we needed them again quickly. We taxied the airplane to [company] Maintenance Hangar where we spoke with maintenance; [ARFF]; as well as with our company about the incident.I think we should clarify the procedures regarding fumes and strongly encourage crews to immediately don oxygen before attempting to diagnose gene situation and identify the source of the odor and what it is even if the smell goes away quickly as toxic fumes can be harmful and lead to incapacitation quickly and without crews realizing. I think our crews should error on theside of caution to avoid a potential more dire situation leading to adverse effects on health and life.
Aircraft,After liftoff as the nose wheel was retracting; we heard a loud bang approximately under the Captain window. We noted airspeed disagree flags illuminated on PFD. I noted erroneous airspeed readings followed by the red stall warning tape and stick shaker warnings. The stick shaker fired continuously until after landing. We completed the memory items for unreliable airspeed. We complied with the QRC and QRH checklist. The First Officer's instruments were determined to be accurate Per QRH checklist. We requested priority handling with Departure; climbed to a safe altitude; and received vectors back to ZZZ for an uneventful landing with Captain's airspeed and altitude unreliable. We coordinated with Dispatch; informed the Flight Attendants; and made a PA to the Passengers. No Passenger issues were noted. After landing; we taxied to the Gate and were told by Ground Control that Airport Ops found that we hit a hawk. The AOA (Angle Of Attack) vane was missing from the aircraft due to the bird strike. Logbook write up was completed and Dispatch helped coordinate all parties for debrief.
Aircraft,ZZZ is a civilian and commercial high use field. ZZZ switched runways. We were able to brief and prepare for the new northbound flow; but it caused numerous operational issues; as many aircraft were waiting for arrivals to the old runway. We taxied single engine; due to congestion. Following startup of [Engine] #1; a slight split throttle situation was observed; but we only taxied forward the length of the aircraft so it was not significant or consistent to warrant further investigation. Compounding the limited ramp and ground space at ZZZ; ATC needed 20 miles separation for northbound departures. We were cleared for takeoff with an aircraft on final and another just clearing the runway. After transferring aircraft control; the PF (Pilot Flying) called set takeoff thrust with A/T (autothrottles) engaged and the PM (Pilot Monitoring) missed the 80-knot call; instead calling 90 knots. The #2 Engine had stabilized IVO (within 0.1-0.3 %) takeoff thrust at the 90-knot call. Since HOLD engaged; the PM attempted to manually match the N1's; but was unable to manually match the #1 Engine. During climb out; the #2 Engine would not advance beyond approximately 87% with AT engaged though the FMC and AT were commanding a higher %. The PM requested and granted control of the engines; disengaged the A/T and attempted to manually advance the #2 Engine to climb thrust. The engine would still not advance beyond approximately 87%; though the white command bar was responding correctly to the manual throttle input and the white arc was visible on the N1 gauge and the #1 engine reacted normally while physically matching the #2 throttle position. No other engine vibrations or anomalies were noted. After cockpit coordination; the PM requested priority handling; received clearance for a lower altitude than assigned and a vector off of the assigned SID. Using Crew coordination; we verified that each of us was seeing the same indications and response from the #2 engine. The PF placed the #2 Engine thrust lever to idle; we ran the checklist with a plan to divert to ZZZ1; while shooting a precautionary single engine approach and keeping the #2 Engine in idle; where it was operating stable and within parameters. We coordinated with ATC and ZZZ1 Operations; who assisted with a patch through to Dispatch Desk. We coordinated with the F/As (Flight Attendants); made a PA; prior to starting our approach into ZZZ1; ran numbers for a flaps 15 landing and ran brake cooling numbers which indicated a 50 minute at the gate cooling time. We transferred aircraft control and the Captain took over the PF duties; while shooting a precautionary single engine visual backed up with an ILS to XXL into ZZZ1. We touched down normally; taxied clear; coordinated with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) #1; who indicated no anomalies were observed. We taxied uneventfully to the gate where the passengers deplaned normally to be accommodated on a later flight under the same flight number. We completed coordination with ZZZ1 Maintenance; Dispatch; Supervisor on Duty; Operations Center Chief Pilot on Call; Manager on Call and Scheduling; while completing Page XXXXXXXX of the logbook.
Aircraft,I'm writing to advise of an interesting event. Aircraft X; ZZZ-ZZZ1. Cruising at FL 380; at XA20 CT; we got an instantaneous #2 Engine LO Quantity 20% and flashing white box. All other oil indications were normal; as well as engine. Prior to event; oil quantities were normal and matched closely. We assessed that we could end up single engine soon; and started looking for nearest suitable airports; if we needed to do that. Additionally; started to review QRC/QRH in preparation for a possible engine failure or shutdown. We coordinated with ZZZ2 Center; for a lower altitude and airspeed. Assigned FL 350; then soon after FL 320. Slowed to74. At XA30 CT; contacted (Company) Dispatch and advised them of our situation; also short conversation with Maintenance. He advised; follow QRH guidance.Top Of Descent; followed soon after; and we continued our assessment of possible landing airports as we monitored the #2 engine. The quantity slowly went down; but would tick up sporadically; then continue down; very slow. While on the arrival branch point; we decided to request preferential coordination direct to ZZZ1. Final approach it was reading 10%; then went to 6% at landing. Landed ZZZ1 Runway XXR uneventfully. While taxi back to terminal; it increased to 20% and remained there at shutdown. Our constant question was; 'what is the limit; zero; or a predetermined %; when the motor would fail?'The next day; I called Maintenance to ascertain if they had found anything out. Maintenance said they were still looking at it with GE Tech Support and had come across Main Bearing and Main Bearing Seal failure; but it wasn't definitive yet. He did tell me that oil was bypassing into another container or void space where it shouldn't go.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On a 5 mile final to Runway 35R at DEN we encountered a GPS loss due to cell tower 5G issues. We were at 7;000 ft. MSL
Human Factors,We taxied out for takeoff and was notified by the West Ramp Control that ZZZ Operations wanted us to return to the ramp due to a concern with our Dangerous goods on board.After coordination with Ramp Control; we parked and shut down our engines to have ramp personnel access the aft cargo bin. I phoned Dispatch to notify them of our situation and to also request that Load Planning join our conversation. The Load planners brief was that one or both of the DG's were unsecured in the aft bin position 6 and needed to be moved to position 4.Ramp personnel moved and secured DG and said we were ready to depart.  We coordinated with Dispatch; Load Planning and confirmed on board fuel. Checklists were completed and we continued uneventfully.
Human Factors,'NO DANGEROUS GOODS PLANNED' [company message] information sent XA:35:38 Just prior to push back (XB:23); received an ACARS msg from [Operations] xx to 'HOLD PUSH PLEASE' without explanation. We relayed hold to ground crew and queried for reason to both LP [Load Planning]; via ACARS; and attempted to contact Operations via VHF but no answer. Ground Crew; from ramp; advised us of having to move bags due to HAZMAT onboard (XB:30). Flight deck did not receive any Hazmat notification paperwork. A phone call to Operations was made by crew and Hazmat was confirmed to be on board; bags were being re-positioned around the Hazmat [cargo]; and paperwork was being sorted out. (XB:49) Flight deck received msgfrom Load Planning that the issue was resolved however; flight deck had still not received any paperwork for the Hazmat.Flight deck questioned Operations about the missing paperwork and was told there was no HAZMAT on board. Questioned Operations again about having to move bags to create barrier for Hazmat. Told the quantity of Hazmat was minimal and doesn't need reported. When asked what it was; Operations didn't know; was making call to cargo. On holdAt XC:08; Dispatch was brought into the loop in hopes to improve communications and information. Dispatch was also put 'on hold' and couldn't get the required information.At XC:24; and after several calls to cargo; it was decided to simply remove the freight until paperwork or information about the contents could be verified. Passengers egress was offered but declined. Shortly thereafter; about XC:30; passengers were now requesting egress. The jetway was attached and they were accommodated. On a side note; we also attempted a call to the Company Hazmat department. The call went unanswered; 'on hold' for over 15 minutes; at which time; the person on the other line informed us that there was no HAZMAT for our flight and unless ZZZ enters it into the system they would have no info. Seems like a big hole in the required reporting or response to any Hazmat issue. They also relayed that the Company Hazmat department was unable to answer our call in a timely manner due to manpower issues. The freight was removed which confirmed that there was indeed NO DANGEROUS GOODS PLANNED . Block out XD:02.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Turning downwind at FFFAT both GPS went out. Turning a 9 mile base; the 'Transponder Fail' light illuminated. This was a known problem happening to all aircraft according to Denver Approach.
Equipment / Tooling,While pushing out Aircraft X and releasing on Taxiway; arm of tow tractor broke down and released aircraft too quickly. Oil and hydraulics leaked on Taxiway and was cleaned by fire department. Aircraft inspected by maintenance and no damage to nose wheel of aircraft.
Environment - Non Weather Related,We were doing the SHFSH arrival to RNAV 26R. We could hear ATC talking to traffic near us but nothing on displays. We flew outbound from VALET intersection leaving 6 for 4 thousand. Suddenly three targets blinked into existence on displays. There was no RA or TA generated.  suspected 5g interference per briefing for 5g interference.keep up the good work with communication and the monitoring of airports and aircraft.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Descending around 13;500 [feet]; [aircraft] hit the wake turbulence of B787 heavy. Had 9 mile spacing. Autopilot disengaged. Aircraft went into upset recovery; I was Pilot Flying; [I announced] 'My aircraft' [and] took over manually. Stabilized aircraft; was cleared descend via. [I] had to offset and depart STAR to gain control; notified ATC; ATC vectored us for RNAV 26R.  Landed uneventfully; no injuries; no damage. Winds were just right to put us into the wake; spacing was adequate however we encountered wake anyway. [When using] descend via following a heavy; ATC should provide offset vectors and descent instructions to keep above and upwind of heavy. Recommend a 1;000 ft. difference above the heavy as we follow it in for approach with an offset of 2 miles upwind. That should keep a good separation to avoid wake.
Human Factors,Pushback was completed with both engines running. Ground crew was unable to release the tow bar. Ask if I would release the parking brake to relieve the pressure on the tow bar. I did. They moved the Aircraft then asked to set brakes but the Aircraft was still moving. I told him to stop the push; he continued to say set brakes. Then I figured out he had released the tow bar. I stopped the Aircraft from moving; set brakes. No injury and Aircraft damage. We had a 90 minute delay due to cargo loading. Ground crew not following SOP. The ground crew needs to review SOP; also have a mindset of not having the urgency to rushing.
Ambiguous,During a discontinued approach at DEN that was commenced above the FAF altitude; I was the Pilot Flying [and] lost situational awareness while distracted by multiple altitude and heading commands by the ATC controller. In addition; I was further distracted by multiple 'Unable RNP'; 'Terr Pos'; and 'ATC Faults' EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) indications during the arrival and approach. The loss resulted in a flap overspeed incursion. While distracted following multiple ATC calls I had failed to ask for Flaps 5 after having previously requested Flap 5 speed. With Flaps 20 set the aircraft exceed the limit for 5 to 7 seconds at a maximum of 6 to 7 knots. I increased the aircraft pitch in the climb while manually reducing thrust to quickly bring the aircraft speed below max flap speed. An [write up] for the overspeed was submitted at the flight's conclusion.The cause of the incident was failure to primarily fly the aircraft while acting as pilot at the controls. Secondarily the controller contributed to the incident by giving multiple rapid instructions; more time should have given to allow the crew to configure the aircraft for the transition from the approach mode to the missed approach/discontinued approach mode.Continued training during simulator training sessions practicing go around and discontinued approach procedures.
Aircraft,"During cruise at FL330; the Flight Engineer brought to the Captain's attention an illuminated #3 CSD (Constant Speed Drive) Oil Pressure Low Light. The Captain elected to call company Maintenance Control to bring them into the decision-making process regarding running of checklists and possible post-flight MEL options. The Flight Engineer and Captain accomplished the associated checklist for the CSD LOW PRESS LIGHT ILLUMINATED; subsequently disconnecting the CSD. There was no further incident until the approach phase of flight nearing ZZZ1 airport. Upon the Captain's call for selection of flaps 2;"" the aircraft experienced #1 and #2 engine-driven AC generators tripped; with associated under-excitation faults Systems 1 and 2; #2 Generator Breaker and #2 Generator Field lights illuminated and the #1 Generator Breaker and #1 Bus Tie Breaker lights illuminated. The Flight Engineer attempted to select the essential power source to STBY but was unsuccessful in restoring essential power using the STBY source. The Engineer attempted then to close the #1 Bus Tie Breaker; which was unsuccessful. At this time the essential power source was selected to the #1 GEN. The Captain had the First Officer [request priority handling] and diversion to ZZZ2 airport where an otherwise normal approach to landing was accomplished.[The problem was identified] upon loss of electrical power with associated loss of lights and instruments. [The cause was] unknown electrical system irregularities and malfunctions. [Responded with an] attempt to restore and protect essential power to the Captain's instruments following procedures and checklists for the related system failures. Subsequently; when it was determined normal course of procedures and checklists would not fully resolve our issues; the decision to [request priority handling] due to loss of electrical power systems and diversion to the nearest suitable airfield with ATC and ARFF (Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting) services."""
Weather,The nose of the aircraft slide across the hold short line of [Runway] XXR. We advised Tower that the nose came across the hold short line. They issued an abort for a AC that was just issued a take off clearance on [Runway] XXR. The Tower thanked us for letting them know soon because the aircraft did not initiate the takeoff role. There was active snow and the hold short line and sine was covered in snow. As I preceded to stop the aircraft it was on ice so it slide to a stop just past the hold short line. The nose was between 5 feet to10 feet past the line The taxiing was difficult because of all the snow very slippery there were many times that the ac was slipping. It would have been nice if the taxi services were plowed and treated. The hold short sine was covered in snow and was difficult to see with the active snow.
Human Factors,After a normal flight and landing at ZZZ we were taxing into Gate XX at ZZZ Terminal XX. We were cleared in to the gate area by Ramp Control; there were rampers waiting for us as we arrived. At Gate XX; the gate next to our assigned gate; another aircraft was waiting on push back; there was another ramp crew with that aircraft also. The marshallers started to wave us in; I lined up on the center line at Gate XX and began to taxi in. A few feet short of the stop line the lead gave us a very sudden stop. I stopped the aircraft and set the parking brake. Within a few minutes it became clear we had collided with the aircraft at Gate XY. We deplaned the passengers normally via the jet bridge.Seems like it was a case of the ramp crew just not paying attention.
Environment - Non Weather Related,No GPS signal on KLN-90B; followed by a confirmation of no GPS via EFB (iPads). Reported to ATC. Other aircraft followed up with more reports. Transponder remained operative but was reported failing in other airplanes. Air Carrier Y aircraft was also seen and reported possibly performing a 'resolution advisory'. The collision path never appeared to show imminent need for reaction. Our TCAS never indicated closer than 1000' in any direction. Not confirmed if the events were related. Still really strange hearing Air Carrier Y on ATC at the same time as GPS outages. GPS failure in our aircraft as well as other aircraft in vicinity. Other aircraft experienced Transponder and GPS full loss of signal.
Procedure,ATC delayed switch from Approach to Tower led to TA and resulting altitude deviation causing a GPWS Caution. Tower then issued a low altitude alert. Helicopter traffic was heading up the Potomac while we were on the river visual approach did not alert us to the on coming traffic. By the time Tower responded we had a RA to descend which led to a GPWS and low altitude alert from Tower. We confirmed traffic in sight and maneuvered back on coarse to correct the deviation; in judgement the safety of flight was not compromised as such we continued the approach to landing on Runway 19. As I believe a go-around would have exacerbated the situation and led to further problems.
Human Factors,Operating ZZZ-ZZZ1 parked at Gate XX we had run the before start checklist all the way through and were ready to push. I verified the ground crew was ready for brake release; released the parking brake and asked the First Officer to call for push. The First Officer called Ramp requesting to push; Ramp cleared us to push giving way to the airplane parking at Gate XY. I relayed these instructions to the ground crew. We didn't move and then the ground crew told me to set the parking brake; which I did. I saw a group of rampers coming out of the terminal looking towards our left wing. I checked to see what they were looking at and then saw that the winglet of the plane parking at Gate XY had hit our aileron. I asked the First Officer to call Ops and get the jet ridge brought back to the plane while I called Dispatch and Maintenance.  Once the cabin door was reopened and the gate agent was aware of what was going on; we deplaned the passengers.Wing walkers should look at wingtips to verify clearance. Verify there is enough space for our aircraft to park at [Gate] XY with a larger aircraft parked at [Gate] XX at ZZZ.
Aircraft,While on approach to Runway XX at ZZZ upon gear down and flaps five selected we received an oral caution alarm. I the Flying Pilot immediately looked down with the corner of my eye and saw Amber dashes and 3 surrounded by Amber boxes on both slat/flap. I was expecting to see an EICAS message of slap or flat fail instead I saw wind shear fail and ground proximity fail. At this time I deviated from the normal go around procedures by hitting altitude hold. I told the First Officer the Non-Flying Pilot inform ATC we were going around. I might have the sequence wrong because everything happened fairly quick so I don't recall if at that point it is when the auto pilot and auto throttles fail or if ATC told us to climb a maintain 2;000 ft. came first.' Regardless that's when I hit TOGA the oral unit started going off stating go around throttles not in TOGA. My first concern was since I was now hand flying and we were only a few hundred feet from 2;000 ft. I intentionally held back the thrust levers so we wouldn't go through the altitude.\n\nI will admit I got a little bit behind the power curve because first I was having to hand fly the go around and second I was confused why a flap/slat fail message was not showing up when we had amber dashes and #3 in boxes and the EICAS messages we were receiving had nothing to do with a slat flaps fail. This caused me to delay the standard call outs; when we were instructed by ATC to climb and maintain 3;000 ft. The Non-Flying Pilot was a great help and assisted in the stander call out and as we cleaned up the aircraft and all the messages and amber boxes went away.''\nSince there were no more messages and therefore 'no QRH checklist to run we circled around executed another approach configured early and the second approach and landing was uneventful.
Human Factors,Received NOTAC forms to carry fire extinguishers in cargo. We realized at cruise that it was not noted on the Dispatch Release. We notified Dispatch via ACARS and amended the Release. Rest of flight [was] uneventful.
Ambiguous,Possible 5G interference event.Normal landing Runway 28R. Slowly; fully stowed thrust reversers after reversers reached idle reverser. ATC said to expedite across Runway 28L due to traffic on final. I advanced the thrust levers but the engines remained at idle thrust. ATC once again said to expedite. I tried once again to advance the thrust levers but the engines remained in idle. ATC had to issues go-around instructions to aircraft on final to Runway 28L. We coasted across Runway 28L and cleared the runway. We explained to ATC that we were having problems with the airplane. I raised the thrust reversers to the idle reverse detent and once again stowed the reversers. I was now able to produce forward thrust. I asked ATC for a phone number and called ATC once we parked at the gate. I spoke with ATC and explained the situation we were having with the airplane. The MAINT light was also illuminated on the overhead panel. We made all appropriate maintenance write ups and debriefed the Maintenance Technician on the issues.
Ambiguous,Departed [Runway]  XXL. First Officer's takeoff. Takeoff and rotation were normal.  Climbing through 400 ft. we heard a chime. Our clearance after takeoff was to turn left and fly heading 350 so when we heard the chime we were in a climbing turn and had just contacted Departure.  Our work load was very high so by the time I looked for the FA (Flight Attendant) call light and did not see it illuminated. Thinking it may have been a mistaken chime I waited to address the chime. The FO (First Officer) put the autopilot on and I picked up the handset but there was no answer. We continued the climb to 23;000 ft. and heard another chime at 7000 ft. I told the FO he had the radios and I answered the handset. The FA stated they thought we had a tail strike. I asked them to standby and I would call them back as we had just received an ATC clearance to FL230. As we passed 10;000 ft. I ran the TAIL STRIKE checklist. I directed the FO to fly and handle ATC. I contacted the FA again to ask if both of the aft FAs thought we had a tail strike and they replied yes.  I requested a level-off at 16;000. We then advised ATC. I sent a Dispatch a call me and informed Dispatch and Maintenance Control. Maintenance Control indicated there was no further guidance he could provide. I inquired as to whether we should burn fuel to get to max landing weight or land over weight. At that point Maintenance Control suggested we speak to the Chief Pilot. The Chief Pilot suggested doing what we could to burn fuel and reduce weight but stated an over weight landing was relatively insignificant.I spoke to the FA and asked if it was possible the noise they heard could have been from the cargo area or an overhead bin. They both stated they felt it was a tail strike. I then ran the [briefing checklist]; I explained the type; no evacuation; no special instructions; and about 20 minutes to landing.  I then informed the passengers that we had a maintenance issue and we would be returning. I added that there would most likely be emergency equipment near the runway but that it was standard practice for a return. We requested a descent to 10;000 ft. to run the checklist which called for us to depressurize the aircraft.  We did continue to fly away from ZZZ but slowed to 240 kts. This was intentional as I felt it would be better to deal with this with less ATC congestion which we would have and in Approach's airspace.We then attempted to pull up landing data and found we could not get it to return information. If this is normal; I would suggest Dispatch should send this automatically. My understanding is that Dispatch has to change the destination for this information to be available so I'm not sure if that was the issue. I pulled up landing distance from the FM but we still needed landing performance data so we sent a message to Dispatch requesting the data. Since we would be landing over weight; we decided it may be best for me to do the approach and landing. We requested a descent to 600 ft. and manually depressurized the aircraft per the checklist. This procedure was distracting since we would open the outflow to achieve 500 FPM climb but every power change would affect the rate of cabin climb or descent.  While the checklist calls for the airplane to be depressurized at 10;000; I felt that if we were able to pressurize at 16;000 ft. we could certainly do so at 6;000 ft. so for passenger comfort I felt it was better to wait until 6;000 to depressurize. We elected to land flaps 30 and auto brakes max. 40 miles from the airport we selected flaps 5 and gear down. During the approach; we configured to flaps 30 at G/S capture (4000 ft.).The approach and landing were uneventful. We completed the parking checklist and sent a report for possible tail strike and over weight landing.Upon inspection after returning to the gate; Maintenance inspected the aircraft and determined there was absolutely no tail strike. Once the passengers were off the aircraft; I debriefed the FAs. One of them stated a previous Captain had told them to be vigilant about listening for tail strike since the 737 MAX is prone to doing so. I contacted the Chief Pilot who did an amazing job. We discussed the event and he inquired as to whether we felt OK to continue. I spoke to my FO and we both agreed we were fine to continue.
Environment - Non Weather Related,At cruise; experienced a dual FMC failure over RAAKK intersection.  FMC's powered back on after about one minute.  Reported to ATC and they verified we were safely on course.  ELB (Electronic Logbook) entry made.  Flight continued normally.
Ambiguous,At 6;300 ft. MSL on the BENKY STAR; Runway 28C Transition; the landing gear warning horn; unsafe landing gear lights; and First Officer's RADALT gave intermittent false warnings. Two separate series of flashes separated approximately 20 seconds apart approaching the TONIE intersection. Uneventful landing. Wrote up discrepancy. Maintenance performed FMC Built in Test equipment check; DFCS (Digital Flight Control System) Built in Test equipment check; and CDS (Cockpit Display System) Built in Test equipment check. All checked good.
Environment - Non Weather Related,We got indications of left GPS fail; then right GPS fail; then transponder fail; all stayed active until after landing.  We notified ATC and they said lots of jets reporting the same.  VMC and no degradation or our navaids was perceptible
Aircraft,An unusual TCAS indication on the takeoff roll resulted in aborted takeoff but this indication only lasted a couple of seconds. This situation resulted in aborted takeoff for safety consideration. Came back to Runway 26L and made normal departure to ZZZ airport.
Human Factors,APU was MELed INOP. Looked to Vol 1 for Alternate Start Procedure. Followed the Manual Start procedures. After selecting Right Eng Start; I selected Fuel Control to RUN. There was some vibration but everything else seemed normal. Looked like a normal start and moved START switch to NORM. As I was getting ready to call for push; I saw the EGT rising. I brought it to the Captain's attention who directed me to go to CUTOFF. At the same time; the Ground Crew is telling the Captain that there is an engine fire. The Captain tried to get confirmation if it was a tail pipe fire. Unable to get a confirmation; the Captain pulled the ENG FIRE handle and discharged #2 bottle for the right engine. There was no FIRE indication in the cockpit; the only indication was the rising EGT reading. After we determined there was no longer a fire we contacted Ramp and Maintenance.
Aircraft,After being cleared the RNAV 26R to MIA the approach was flown using standard procedures. At 1;000 AGL we were stable; configured and on glide slope. Following the 1;000 ft. call out I noticed the glide slope started bouncing up and down as if there was some interference. We continued on the PAPI as we were in visual conditions. As we continued on the approach; the glide slope oscillations got more severe until the glide slope eventually went full scale deflection. Still in visual conditions and on glide slope we continued the approach. We touched down in the TDZ and the approach/landing was completed uneventfully. Upon turning off the runway we realized that we were still on with Approach Control and were never given the handoff to Tower for a landing clearance. Upon realizing the mistake we contacted Tower to cross the parallel runway and taxied to the gate. The flight was completed without incident. I believe the mistake was caused by a combination of a distraction with the glide slope amid ongoing company issues with 5G coupled with Approach Control not giving us a frequency change to Tower. Maintaining better situational awareness allowing us to query ATC when not given frequency change we were expecting.
Procedure,Failed to put alternate on for 5G NOTAM.Worked up all ZZZ flights no alternate; no NOTAM and got complacent with ZZZ1 weather no alternate required. Put additional fuel on for winds/ATC but did not put alternate. Added ZZZ2 while enroute.Put alternate on all locations with 5g NOTAM regardless of weather.
Weather,While turning on to [taxiway] SC the aircraft started to slide. I placed the throttles in reverse idle to make sure I did not depart the taxiway that was covered in ice and snow. I was at my slowest possible but wanted to make sure that I had reverse thrust available if I continued to slide down SC that has a steep decline. The throttles did not come out of reverse idle but the right engine flamed out. We attempted to restart the right engine but approached a hot start approximately 547 degrees. We stopped the right engine start procedure and stopped taxiing because the taxiway condition was nil and could not get any traction with the nose wheel or differential breaking for the turn. Requested snow crews plow the ramp and tug crew pull us into the gate. We were towed without incident after the snow crews plowed the ramp.
Ambiguous,While being vectored on to RNAV 24Y with Roanoke Approach received a 'Terrain Pull Up' EGPWS warning. Aircraft was on a base leg between PROSE and HIBAN south of the final approach course at 4;000 ft. PF (Pilot Flying) complied with company procedures and climbed in response to the warning. Approach Control vectored aircraft back around for the same approach starting at a higher altitude.
Aircraft,While on final approach to Runway XXL approximately at 700 feet; the First Officer disconnected the autopilot to perform the landing. I heard the autopilot disconnect sound follow by a strong noise. The First Officer told me that the control column got 'stuck' momentarily and he pushed it forward and it got free (I was looking outside when it happened). We looked into the problem [and] everything was working normal. No CAS (Crew Alert System) indications; hydraulics were looking good and flight control page was good. The flight controls were moving correct and free. We continued with the landing.
Ambiguous,It was a night flight from ZZZ1 to ROA. We were receiving vectors for the RNAV 24 approach into ROA. The Approach Controller's vectors brought us east of the airport. At this time we were maintaining 5;200 ft. as per our altitude assignment. Approaching roughly 10nm east of PROSE; approach cleared us direct to PROSE. When the aircraft had finished the turn to the fix; we were roughly on a 270 heading. We then received the clearance to cross PROSE at 5;200 ft. and cleared for the RNAV 24 approach. While enroute to PROSE at 5;200 ft.; we received a ground proximity indication; and an aural message 'Terrain' followed by 'Pull up.' Moments later I disconnected the autopilot; applied maximum thrust and initiated a climb to 7;000 ft. The indications ended shortly after we started climbing. The FO (First Officer) promptly reported our situation to the Controller. The Controller could not provide us with a reason as to why we got the indications; as according to the Controller; we were above the highest obstacle in the area. The Controller gave us a new clearance for the approach and we did not receive any further ground proximity warnings.
Ambiguous,Shortly after liftoff from [Runway] 22R  at JFK on Aircraft X; First Officers side Radio Altimeter rolled down to a negative 5; continuing the climb out the RA seems to go back to normal at approximately 500 ft or so.
Ambiguous,After departing Runway 28R from PIT; at about 200 ft.; App 2 not avail msg and LDG ATT msg in FO (First Officer) HUD and RA (Radar Altimeter) on FO side displayed erroneous readout. FO RA displayed -5 ft. climbing thru 28;000 ft. No issues descending into ZZZ. Maintenance was advised and they deferred FO RA. I was told it would be replaced on the overnight.
Human Factors,On Date 1 (3) TC cell batteries were shipped out of third party vendor from Address X on shipper [account] which was flagged as a Dangerous Goods item. It was reported on Date 2 from ZZZ that the shipment was shipped without properly identifying that the cell batteries shipped incorrectly without outer visual UN 3090 markings and no dangerous good declarations was found on the inside of the container with the cell batteries. Third party vendor immediately notified Quality Control person whom resides at Address X about the incorrect shipment. The shipment did ship on a Company cargo aircraft. We want to ensure disclosure of the incident and that all parties involved have been notified and proper actions to mitigate recurrence. Actions to contain only DG (Dangerous Goods) Certified shippers can access and ship out DG related items was taken along with a two people buy-off activity.
Aircraft,On departure from ZZZ; ED2 displayed many temporary messages and I noticed an intermittent FMS flag on PFD1. The FO (First Officer) reported a burnt plastic smell; and GEN 1 went offline with a GEN1 caution message.  Since the APU was deferred; we were single gen.  We requested our present heading and a level off altitude; which ATC gave us.  We complied with the QRH for GEN1 caution; and the message did not clear.  We requested priority handling.  We messaged Dispatch that we wanted to return ZZZ; Dispatch agreed; and we requested delay vectors to burn off fuel.  L window; and L windshield caution messages were still posted from the initial round of messages.  We completed the QRH for L windshield and the messages cleared.  We requested landing on XXC and said we would advise approach when we were ready.  We talked to the FA (Flight Attendant); then briefed the passengers; saying we would be returning to ZZZ as a precaution; we would be on the ground in about 40 minutes; airport equipment might be standing by as a precaution; and we expected a normal landing.  We prepared for the approach; accomplished all checklists and returned to ZZZ.  We landed below max landing weight.  ARFF was standing by; so we requested they inspect the left engine.  They reported no smoke or leaking so we requested taxi to the gate.  I asked the crew if they were okay; they said yes.  No passengers reported being distressed.We decided since there was no apparent indication that there was a fire to decline ARFF (Airport Rescue Fire Fighting) services initially.  Perhaps we should have requested them regardless.  Based on recommendations of our previous [supervisor]; we decided to request priority handling as a precaution.  The benefits of priority handling seemed necessary for us in the event the situation deteriorated.  This is also why I requested Runway XXC.  It was the closest runway for the airport's configuration at the time.  My thinking was that if a fire started; we should be prepared for the approach which would minimize the distance traveled as well as the aircraft that might need to be vectored out of our way.  It also made sense to me to use a runway that was already in use if we did not require special handling.  Those were the things I saw as risk factors for landing after an inflight fire.  We also considered some of the airports below us as we received delay vectors.  I am open to suggestions from the [Review Team] about how I might improve my decision-making skills as it relates to this scenario.
Human Factors,We departed ZZZ for HRL not requiring an alternate and the TAF forecast showed stable conditions throughout the day. This was the first leg of the four day trip and the FO (First Officer) informed me he had not flown for a month. After we got the ATIS weather at the field; which seemed like it took longer than normal to get; we set up for the RNAV 35L as advertised. ATIS F which I believe stated OVC019 and 10sm then FO said it was changing. After a long pause; ATIS G was 330/9 2 1/2mi -RA BR OVC009. Certainly not what was advertised when we left ZZZ but still more than sufficient for the RNAV approach. We got no message from Dispatch along the way indicating weather had changed. Approach Control gave us vectors for what appeared to be just outside of AVUDE so I had the FO sequence us with a line off of AVUDE. I believe we actually ended up just outside BOTVE and while I was contemplating how to correct this in the FMS so we would know when to descend we were rapidly approaching AVUDE and this left us 500 ft. higher than we should have been approaching AVUDE. I attempted to descend so as to catch the VPI and may have exceeded 1200 ft. per min momentarily. Callouts left something to be desired but neither of us expected this approach to go down to minimums or even close. Maybe the FO called out minimums but I don't recall hearing it. I did look up as we were approaching mins. sort of in disbelief that I had not heard runway in sight to attempt to see the runway. When I looked back down I immediately initiated the missed approach and I believe I may have gone below the MDA by approximately 50 ft. This was not intentional and neither of us could believe this was actually happening. The go around went well and ATC asked us to state our intentions. I asked the FO what the winds were but got no response. I could have queried ATC but I knew they were near the tailwind limit so I instructed the FO to request the ILS backcourse 35L. My thought was it would at least get us a bit lower. With workloads already high there wasn't time to discuss alternates with Dispatch. We got short vectors back in for the ILS BC. We had excellent ground contact; the airport environment in sight and good visibility but a low hanging cloud made it harder to see the runway until we were clear of it and we made an uneventful landing with just under 1800 lb of fuel. This runway has no approach lights which makes it even more difficult. Low on gas and low on options was not how I expected this flight to end up. It could have easily resulted in a fuel emergency if we had to go around again.I think the biggest takeaway here for me is that I should have reached out to Dispatch for an alternate plan as soon as we got the weather in HRL. I'm not sure if I just misheard the FO when he read it off or what but it just didn't click that there was potentially going to be an issue. Neither of us thought we would have an issue with the weather getting in. I should have requested the current winds from ATC and this may have allowed me to request the ILS 17R but with wet runway numbers I don' know if it was possible. Also it would be a huge benefit to have approach lights or at least some strobes on the end of 35L. This would help to easily identify it through thin cloud layers or haze. Brownsville and McAllen were closer than I thought they were but I did not have current weather at either location. Again quick thinking should have been to get ATC working on an alternate nearby airport with good weather while we did the second approach.
Aircraft,Upon taking runway and cleared for take off; Captain transferred control to Copilot and advanced throttles and pushed TOGA levers upon call out for Set Take Off Thrust. Left engine did not advance any further while right engine advanced to takeoff power. Aircraft yawed to the left; Captain reclaimed control of aircraft and aborted take off. Copilot notified ZZZ Tower of aborted take off. Remained on runway for 2 minutes to examine left engine responsiveness. Engine was non responsive to thrust lever movement and determined aircraft was unfit to fly. Notified ATC that aircraft would be returning to gate. Left engine remained unresponsive the entire way back to gate. Returned aircraft to maintenance for troubleshooting.
Ambiguous,Intercepting Final for Visual Runway 24 at BDL; leveling at 2100 MSL; APP armed with localizer capture aircraft seemed to capture G/S as aircraft began descending received Caution and EICAS 'Autopilot' message; GS on PFD had amber line through it; PF (Pilot Flying) disconnected A/P recaptured G/S manually by adding power to shallow descent; (we were half dot low and descending) Amber bar disappeared from G/S roll mode; EICAS Autopilot message extinguished; PM (Pilot Monitoring) re-engaged A/P; all 3 A/P's engaged and Autoland Status showed LAND 3; Approach continued without further incident. Possible 5G interference.
Aircraft,When lowering gear left hydraulic quantity went to .14 and PTU did not operate. We discontinued approach and ran checklists. Requested priority handling; complied with QRH and landed. Hydraulic system leak in left landing gear circuit.
Ambiguous,During my shift the night of Date; I was very busy due to the weather situation across [area] with many aerodromes in the IFR-LIFR range. I was selecting alternates that were +1:00 away from airports in southern [area]. Originally I just had ZZZ1 on the release; but selected a second alternate of ZZZ2. The original release was sent with two alternates ZZZ2 and ZZZ1. ZZZ2 was illegal due to the new policy of alternate selection of weather at less 600-2 due to the 5G NOTAMS. I saw the weather had been forecast just below weather alternate minimums. I ACARS the crew and had them remove ZZZ2 from the release since weather was forecast below alternate mins. The biggest thing is the increase in alternate minimums; which recently changed. High workload for the west central region during the shift due to IFR-LIFR conditions across the worked region. Flight was released late due to meteorology writing an exception TAF for ZZZ3 around XA00Z when all the Routine TAFs go out. Meteorology had been busy issuing the XAZ company TAFs. First; better diligence on my part on knowing the new policy in place now for adding an alternate. I did add ZZZ2 has a second alternate with ZZZ1 as the primary. Second; newer flight planning system that highlights closures; alternates or greys out them out as an options (an AI intelligence) that is able to tell us if an alternate is legal to use or not with forecast weather.
Ambiguous,Upon departing ZZZ we pulled weather for GEG; it was 1000 rvr fzfg. We set up for the CAT III into Runway 21; at the top of descent we got the ATIS and the weather had improved WE NOW HAD 6000+ rvr and ovc 100. We decided to shoot the CAT III anyway for practice; we turned final at 10 miles out and had the runway insight. We continued down the approach with no anomalies; about 500 ft. we looked a little left of course but continued at around 200 ft. the FO (First Officer) announced that we were a little left. I disconnected the auto pilot shifted the aircraft back to the right and landed without incident. I feel we were about 100 ft. left of center line and would have hit the left edge runway lights had we not taken control of the aircraft. I hate to think what would have happened if we were in actual CAT III conditions as we probably would not have had time to correct the problem.
Ambiguous,We were given radar vector to intercept ILS 33; just out side of CUVOT to maintain 2;500; suddenly got pull up terrain; IMC at the time we executed go-around.
Aircraft,Aircraft just came out of a C check; on takeoff roll received master caution OVHT/DET around 100 kts; on [takeoff] rotation Fire Warning annunciated along with bell and APU Fire pull handle illuminated. These indications flickered on and off and then off. Requested level off to work problem and to stay close to the field. Warning did not come back. From what we saw we believed the problem was just an indication problem that went away. We elected to proceed to ZZZ1. Then almost immediately the Fire warning came back and stayed continuously illuminated with bell only flickering off a few times. Did immediate action items; pulled APU Fire switch and fired the bottle. Requested priority handling. Continued with QRC and Fire illumination did not go away for good so per the QRC we landed at nearest suitable airport; ZZZ. Before landing I notified our FAs (Flight Attendants); notified our Passengers and [contacted] Dispatch. After landing had Fire Rescue trucks inspect aircraft. Once given all clear; we taxied to the gate.
Procedure,On arrival we were assigned 3;000 feet. 4 crew members heard the same instructions. ATC delayed our turn from downwind to base to final. I configured accordingly in anticipation of a short approach. At some point; we received a terrain warning. I immediately turned right and climbed as I deemed appropriate; ATC never assigned a heading and simply advised us that we should be at 3;800 feet. We kept asking for a heading and approach clearance at that point. He seemed a bit confused and I believe he forgot about us and never monitored our position on final. We had a stable final approach and landing. I called the tower to address the approach controllers clearance and they said it was normal and it was not an issue; of course this is what's I heard; a lack of communication and a different English dialect may have been a distinct factor in this event.
Ambiguous,Performed a normal ILS approach to Runway 28R. Turned off the auto-pilot at approximately 1;500 feet. During flare; at approximately 3 feet; the auto ground spoilers deployed. Causing the aircraft to pitch up and the main wheels to touch down. The auto spoilers should not have deployed until the aircraft was on the ground. Suspect some sort of interference from 5G to the radio altimeter.
Ambiguous,At approximately 6000 ft. MSL on the EAGUL6 arrival into PHX near BASSL; the FO (First Officer) had two RA fail (Yellow RA on the FO PFD) indications that each lasted approximately 1 second. The CA (Captain) had no RA fail indications.
Airport,We were making the turn into the gate to park. I had just shut off my taxi light so I wouldn't blind the rampers and checked to see that the area was clear. I saw a catering truck on our right and thought it was slowing so I turned my head back to the left towards our parking spot. Just then I saw movement out of the corner of my eyes and the First Officer braked hard to prevent a collision with the catering truck that tried to speed in front of us. If we didn't stop and the catering truck kept going then we would have been close to colliding. I always brief my First Officer's to use the brakes if they think they need to and I will thank them later. That was exactly how that worked out.The driver of the truck was either poorly trained or was inattentive.Briefing the First Officer to use the brakes empowers them to use their judgment to keep us safe. Ramp drivers need better training.
Aircraft,Upon climb out of ZZZ we noticed a strong odor of wet dog/dirty sock in the flight deck. I asked the Flight Attendant if they noticed an odor and they said they had; but most noticeably in forward cabin. We donned our O2 masks and ran QRH checklist and smell seemed to dissipate enough that we continued to destination. Filled out the odor form and put an entry in Approved Model List.Flight attendants flew same aircraft in night before. Aircraft sat overnight in wet/rainy conditions. Odor was noticed by flight deck and in First class cabins. Odor seemed to dissipate as flight continued. Passengers noticed odor; but no one complained of symptoms or irritations. Followed QRH procedures. Wrote the odor up in Approved Manuel List in ZZZ1 and filled out odor form. [Captain's suggestion was to] find out the cause of these odors and do everything possible to eliminate them.
Aircraft,Inbound aircraft had Green SYS LO PR event on ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) on arrival. Inbound Captain told me the Green SYS HYD pressure went to zero. There were multiple previous discrepancies for green sys lo pressure and other green sys discrepancies. MX (Maintenance) took the aircraft and [Maintenance Control] told me parts were on the way from ZZZ to fix the problem. Shortly after; I was informed that the aircraft had been returned to service with MEL 29-12-F ECAM Warnings and Cautions for Eng Pump LO PRESS. I called [Maintenance Control] and inquired about the MEL. He told me that ZZZ1 MX did not like working on Airbus A/C and put the MEL on before consulting [Maintenance Control]. With many previous discrepancies; I did not feel that the MEL was appropriate for the current status of the aircraft. The aircraft was in a MX base.There seemed to be a lack of communication between the ZZZ1 MX base and [Maintenance Control].Better communication among all that were involved would have had a better potential outcome.
Aircraft,Traffic Collision Avoidance System Traffic Advisory on Approach. Was Pilot Flying on Flight ZZZ-RSW. Flew the SHFTY 5 RNAV Arrival for the ILS Runway 06. Handed off to RSW Approach. Was instructed to expect the visual Runway 06 with vector over Estero Bay. Given a northwest vector (right-base-to-final) before PONTY intersection. Cleared for the visual by approach inside of TROPC intersection (IAF; D12.6 IRSW) I selected 1500 ft. into the Altitude Window for DOLPN (FAF) and pulled Open Descent. I armed the approach mode. To the best of my memory; I know we were inland of the bay; approximately 2 miles before DOLPN when capturing the localizer. The aircraft was approximately between an altitude of 1700 ft. to 1500 ft. descending when I viewed an intermittent proximate intruder Traffic Collision Avoidance System display. It was visible; gone; visible at first and quite erratic. I was already in the 10 mile range. The First Officer and I immediately began a quick scan for traffic in the area. At about the time the aircraft captured 1500 ft.; we received an aural 'Traffic; Traffic' TA advisory. However; I saw no amber TA intruder symbol but a white proximate traffic symbol showing 1500 ft. below our altitude which was still at 1500 ft. We both continued our scans; and the target disappeared. The First Officer queried the Tower for any known traffic in the area; to which he responded no. We continued the approach; caught the glide slope and landed uneventfully. [The cause was the targets were] erratic; realistically made no sense with the altitudes; not visible to the crew; and unknown to ATC.
Ambiguous,After take-off; somewhere between 1000 and 2000 ft.; I lost the flight director (First Officer side). Also missing was the airspeed bug and the FMAs on the Primary Flight Display (the thrust FMA was still displayed; but the pitch and roll ones were blank). A red 'FD2' was displayed on the Primary Flight Display. The Captain's (Pilot Flying) instruments looked normal. As our Autopilot number 1 was MEL'd; the Captain could not bring on the autopilot until I got valid information on my side. Selecting Sys 1 FD switch to display his information on my side returned the FMAs and the flight director; but still no airspeed bug; so the autopilot would not engage. Changing to Level Change (from profile climb) displayed an airspeed bug on my side. It matched the setting on the FCP; and moved with it appropriately when the speed was changed. The Captain was then able to engage Autopilot number 2. It appears the lack of airspeed bug on my side had something to do with the profile mode; although the Captain had a good display; and the information on our Flight Management System Center Display Units appeared to all match. After level-off at FL250; the Flight Management System stayed in climb mode. We tried changing the cruise altitude; going from Econ to Speed and Max Climb; to no avail. It stayed in Climb mode until sometime after we were below 10000 ft. The Captain disengaged the autopilot once we were approaching ZZZ; so I de-selected the FD1 info; and my Primary Flight Display was then displaying normally. Normally; I would not make this an safety report; but we had a very similar situation two nights before in a different jet when we departed from SAT Runway 04. In that case; the First Officer side lost the Flight Director and airspeed bug. I did not notice the missing FMAs that night; but cannot be sure. In that case; we had an operable Autopilot number 1; so the Captain took the aircraft and used Autopilot number 1. After level-off; I de-selected FD1; and my displays were normal. With a very strange; but similar occurrence on two different jets; I'm wondering if this is somehow related to 5G transmissions. From what I was able to see online; it appears there may be a Tower not far from the departure end of Runway 04 at SAT. [The cause was] unknown. Possible 5G transmission effects; or coincidental failures (and recovery) of equipment on 2 different jets on different days in a very similar fashion. I've made this report in case others are received for similar issues; [and] to help with gathering the data.
Human Factors,Operations notified me that ZZZ hub had neglected to include some accessible dangerous goods in position 9L on the D.G. (Dangerous Goods) paperwork.  List of D.G. in that position sent to me; which I then forwarded to flight crew when I notified them. List of D.G. copied below. Notified Duty Officer as well; flight continuing to ZZZZ.Since this issue was caused by a failure on the part of the [Load Control] hub; I'm not sure what the root cause was; you would have to contact them.
Aircraft,On climb out when climbing through 2;200 ft.; my altimeter froze there and my airspeed dropped to zero. My First Officer side was still operating and I tried troubleshooting by switching to the alternate static source while still climbing. When I switched to the alternate static source the altimeter jumped to 3;000 ft. but then stayed stuck there. ATC asked me why it looked like I had leveled off between 2;000 to 3;000 ft. and I advised them that I was actually climbing through 8;000 ft. and was going to level off at 8;500 ft. and I had an issue with my pitot static system. After troubleshooting realizing that I wouldn't be able to fix the issue and ZZZ was still VFR I told them I would air return to ZZZ and they vectored me back. I do not believe this would be considered an altitude deviation as I was cleared to climb to 10;000 ft. and had not made it there yet.
Ambiguous,On arrival into MHT; Captain and I received a 1800 FT radio altimeter indication at 5000 FT.
Ambiguous,At or just before reaching the final fix on the CLT JONZI2 arrival we saw momentary fail flags for GS; VPITCH; the flight plan dropped out (but left the approach in) and time and fuel calculation displays showed dashes. AP was engaged. The aircraft started to turn; reaching about 110 deg M before I got heading mode engaged. HDG was just being set to 090* per just received ATC heading instruction but I had not yet selected HDG when the turn started.In case this was a 5G issue I pressed the flight data event button. Don't know. The STAR has a 090 terminating HDG for the runway in use; which happened to match the ATC instruction just received.
Aircraft,En-route from ZZZ to ZZZ1 in cruise at FL360 with approximately 1 hour remaining in the 3 hours and 2 minute flight we began to hear an audible clicking noise every so often over the COMMS system. At first we were not sure what was causing but did not to indicate any issues with communication. Then soon later it became aware from both flying pilot and non flying pilot that were no longer capable of hearing any transmissions from ATC. We tried calling on both Comm 1 and Comm 2 but both were having issues and hearing the audible sounds whenever attempting to transmit. Afterwards we began making numerous attempts to regain contact via both radios; handheld mics; different headsets; communication plug ins including the jump seat panel as well as the backup radio. None were successful; however we were able to maintain a form of communication via ACARS with dispatch and communicated our situation with them and requested they loop ATC in. Per the FOM after seeing as we had lost communication we squawked 7600. We attempted to communicate the situation to the Flight Attendants but it seemed the problem had also affected our ability to communicate with the Flight Attendants. We then used alternative means to communicate with them with notes passed between the door. Relaying our situation and plan; as well as remaining flight time and to secure the cabin and prepare for landing. They did an excellent job of keeping the cabin operations routine and the issue completely unknown to the passengers. Dispatch continue to relay via ACARS additional frequencies to try along our route as well as instructions from ATC to start a descent to 12;000 feet at ZZZZZ en-route to ZZZ1. Dispatch also relayed additional actions to attempt to regain communication. At this point our dispatcher requested priority handling on our behalf. Shortly before reaching our descent point at ZZZZZ the non-flying pilot was able to regain radio contact via the backup radio and establish communication with ATC. They proceeded to give us the same direction we had from dispatch to descend and maintain 12;000 feet. We then proceeded the remaining of the flight in full contact with ATC. We continue to fly the ZZZZZ1 RNAV arrival as planned and then proceed to request the RNAV RNP Z Runway XX. ATC cleared us as requested and proceeded along with a clearance to the approach and to land on Runway XX at ZZZ1 prior to reaching the IAF of ZZZZZ2. We flew the approach to a safe landing on Runway XX and proceeding to the gate without anymore issue and being in contact with ATC ever since regaining contact with them. Upon reaching the gate we deplaned without issue as normal. It was truly an excellent performance working the problem from both pilots and flight attendants. As well as communicating between flight attendants. Overall was a great team effort between; pilots; flight attendants; dispatcher; and ATC to work the problem and conclude with flight safely.
Human Factors,While working Aircraft X; I failed to see a DG (Dangerous Goods) [parcel] in A2 of Aircraft X. I put [in] front in A1 so I had a support person in the [cargo compartment] who I thought would have checked before getting out. I was on [Gate] XY with a XA:00 departure. I start at XZ:00 and have to scan my first bag by XZ:22. My support help was not at the gate at the start of my loading. I started with bags because I needed to make sure I met the 38 minute required by Local management.I was called into the office by the managers and they told me there was a DG (Dangerous Good) override [error] on my flight.The event occurred because the DG was never removed from the aircraft the night before. The support person who loaded the freight in A1 did not say anything about a PPS (Priority Package Service) in A2. I was focusing on my times for 1st bag scans and the support person was not part of the huddle before I started loading the flight because he wasn't at the gate.I had to go into a [meeting] and discuss what happened.[I should] not expect someone to do what I should have done. [I should] get verification. I need more time for first trips of the day because of the external security search I'm required to perform.
Procedure,Aircraft X was IFR for Runway 26 at PHX. Aircraft Y was IFR for Runway 25L at PHX. Both aircraft were on 30 degree intercepts for their runways and cleared for the visual approach. Aircraft X went through final at almost the same altitude as Aircraft Y on the parallel runway. Separation was less than a mile and maybe 100 ft. Even though both aircraft were cleared for the visual approach and given 30 degree intercept headings they became dangerously close. The operation is completely acceptable in the 7110.65 but is very dangerous. This happens regularly with parallel runway operations at this facility.The 7110.65 needs to be changed to mandate standard separation until aircraft are established inbound on the final approach course. According to the 7110.65 paragraph 7-4-4; nobody is responsible for the IFR separation of 2 IFR aircraft. This operation is extremely unsafe and used at many busy airports with parallel runway operations. Many of the final approach courses are over highly populated cities. The risk of a catastrophic event is high.
Human Factors,During departure; we experienced some minor wake turbulence from a departing heavy aircraft.  While hand flying; I deviated 10 degrees right while navigating to the BONLE fix; but I didn't notify ATC as we were VFR.  When we asked for right turn direct to the next fix; we were queried if we were proceeding direct to BONLE fix.  We replied 'yes; but request direct JBNCH'.  The Controller; clearly confused of our current heading just gave us his own heading; and then cleared us to JBNCH less than a minute later.  No other conflict or deviation occurred.
Human Factors,On arrival assigned POKON 2A arrival and then direct to EMROS. Time of day was civil twilight with smoke limiting visibility. We were then given 3;000 feet and read back 3;000 feet for radar vectors for Runway 27. ATC delayed our turn downwind to base to final. On base leg we saw terrain ahead and received a terrain warning from aircraft. Captain immediately turned right and climbed. ATC hesitated with assigning heading and simply advised we should climb to 3;800 feet. We asked for a heading to intercept approach course and clearance for approach. ATC seemed confused and believe he wasn't monitoring our approach. We had stable final approach and landing. After shutdown the Captain called the controllers to discuss approach. They said it was normal and not an issue. A lack of communication and language barrier may have been a factor in this event.
Human Factors,After pushback and engine start during initial taxi out I had to stop the aircraft abruptly after attaining momentum for my turn out for a ground vehicle entering my taxi path.
Environment - Non Weather Related,The incident occurred today on leg 3 of day 5 for me on reserve. I was the Pilot Flying. We were cleared to 4;000 ft. to join from the north on a 240 heading intercept for the RNAV GPS 27R approach into ORD. We had made the turn to 240 in IMC to intercept and I armed LNAV. The aircraft started to bank in the opposite direction (left) of desired course. We were queried by ATC to make sure we were aligning with 27R. I corrected our course with no incident but have never seen the aircraft pitch in that way when already intercepting to the right. We were told to call TRACON that 3 other aircraft earlier that day had experienced something similar with a bank to the left.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Taxiing from gate; approaching A7; ATL Ground cleared us A7 A 26R; taxi speed 15 kts. Fire Truck approaching from the right; high rate of speed crossed in front of us on service road. If I had not stood on the brakes a collision would have occurred. Fire Truck never slowed. Explained the situation to Ground Controller and said that it happens a lot. Fire Truck was returning to station. Did NOT have emergency lights on. Fire Truck driver ignoring ground procedures. Have fire truck driver abide by ground vehicle rules.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On arrival; approximately 30 miles north of ZZZ; we were descending to 6;000 ft; when Approach informed us that the Tower would be closing in 5 minutes without explanation. We had prepared and briefed a visual approach to Runway XX per the ATIS; with no NOTAMs pertaining to a Tower closure. I was the Flying Pilot; and we decided to slow down and configure the aircraft early so that we could keep our heads up and watch out for traffic. At approximately 10 miles north of the airport; Approach asked us if we had the airport in sight; we acknowledged; and they cleared us for a visual approach to Runway XX. We switched to the CTAF frequency; announced our position; altitude; and intentions; began a gradual descent to 4;000 ft. and entered directly into the traffic pattern on a left downwind. The CTAF frequency was very active with aircraft announcements for simultaneous departures and landing to BOTH intersecting runways. We were inundated with TCAS targets coming from all directions; altitudes; and proximity; from as little as 500 ft. below us and 700 ft. above. We observed targets that seemed to be popping out of nowhere; over or alongside mountains; out of valleys; and several that were just flying low in the valley itself. All unannounced. It was almost like flying in a beehive. Our radio calls were continuous; as we announced our position; altitude and intention. We entered a left base to intercept a 10 mile final; and I began to have reservations about conducting an approach with so much traffic. I began to contemplate abandoning the approach altogether and started to consider where a plausible alternate might be; but decided to continue to 5 miles out as my decision point. At about 7 miles; a Cessna in a close in pattern announced that he was going to be making a left base turn to Runway XX; essentially right in front of us. We made several more calls advising our position and distance from the airport; and I became virtually certain that we would need to abandon the approach; but was waiting to acquire the aircraft visually before going around. Moments later someone using a ground-based radio (Airport Operations) advised the aircraft who was about to turn in front of us to extend downwind since we were on short final. The aircraft stated that he had us in sight and would continue downwind and land behind us. We could also hear other aircraft throughout the approach making sporadically coherent/incoherent announcements for departures and landings to Runway YY; with various traffic pattern variations; but none seemingly aware of our approach to the intersecting runway; or the spacing that might be necessary to accommodate safe separation.We landed; turned off at XX2 to Taxiway XX to the ramp. We announced that we were clear of the runway and would be taxiing across the approach end of Runway YY on A. We heard a helicopter announce that he was on a tight right base turn to Runway YY; but couldn't see him because he would have been above and behind us. We scanned the area and proceeded; just as the helicopter was cut off by a Cessna landing straight in to Runway YY. That aircraft went over the top of us; and we saw him outside the FO's (First Officer) side window as he passed over the top of us at about 50 ft. We couldn't believe it. We taxied into the ramp; and parked. We were both shaken by the stressful environment. As we began deplaning; I noticed an airport vehicle parking just in front of our left wing and the driver got out and made visual contact with me in the cockpit; so I went out to speak to him. He advised me that the Tower was closed due to COVID; and that it would be closed until XA:00 am the next day. I asked him if he had been observing the traffic around the airport; and told him that someone flew over the top of us on the approach end of Runway YY. He said that he had been listening to the radio and watching the traffic; relating that he had overheard an argument between two aircraft attempting to land Runway ZZ & YY at the same time in opposite directions. He described the conditions as total chaos with a 'bunch of idiots' who didn't know what they were doing. He went further to say that the airport was never designed for this type of traffic; as it was simply a modified military airport. I told him about the traffic conflicts we had experienced on landing; and we both agreed that operating a 121 category aircraft in the current conditions without a Tower in operation was not safe. I returned to the cockpit; the First Officer and I debriefed; and together we concluded that based on the current volume of traffic; operation into ZZZ without a Control Tower was simply unsafe for our category of aircraft. Both of us agreed that our scheduled return leg from ZZZ1 would require us to fly almost directly into the setting sun; at a time when people would be focused on watching the sunset over the [surrounding areas]; and at a time of the day when aircraft traffic volume was sure to be exceptionally high with a variety of different aircraft types. Without an operating Control Tower managing traffic flow to the two intersecting runways; providing aircraft separation and advisories; we concluded from our first-hand experience; that the risks associated with continuing our flight within our scheduled time frame was simply unsafe.I called our Dispatcher to advise her of the Tower closure; what we had experienced on our arrival; and our concerns for safety on the return flight into ZZZ from ZZZ1 within our scheduled time frame. I explained to her that we would be willing to fly the plane out of ZZZ given our capability to climb quickly away from the potentially conflicting traffic and congestion; but that we would not be willing to return given the current conditions. She said that she was going to reach out to her Supervisor; who I believe ultimately cancelled our flight; but we never received official confirmation from anyone.Shortly thereafter; I received a call from my Chief Pilot with an inquiry about our situation. I briefly described what we had experienced; and that we didn't believe it was safe to operate our return flight into ZZZ in the current conditions. He explained that we operate in uncontrolled airport conditions all the time; and I agreed. He asked me if I had the capability to predict air traffic volume; and I told him I did not. He then asked me if I was 'shutting down the operation'; and I said that I was not; but that I personally would not be willing to return to ZZZ based on the current conditions. Clearly frustrated and unsupportive of my decision; He requested an [report] and informed me that; 'this would not be the last I heard of this'. In summary; I refused a return flight segment to ZZZ in compliance with regularly scheduled operations for an uncontrolled airport due to safety concerns rising from traffic saturation in the terminal environment based on current conditions; the unscheduled closing of the airport Control Tower; and loss of ATC services that are normally available at this time of day. While we did not have a crystal ball that would have enabled us to see or anticipate what the traffic volume would be on our return; given the short round trip; we did not anticipate that it would change significantly over time; and rather than returning to what we believed would be similar conditions to those we had just experienced; we notified the company of our unwillingness accept what we believed were unacceptable risks to safety of flight.Unscheduled Tower closure due to COVID; loss of ATC services; high volume of aircraft operating in the vicinity; utilization of two intersecting runways operating simultaneously; poor situational awareness and communication by GA aircraft operating in the terminal environment; lack of adherence to standard traffic patterns and altitudes among by GA aircraft in the terminal environment. I also believe this was sort of a perfect storm situation; in that with the conditions being perfect for flying; the time of day; the greater ZZZ environment was unusually congested with GA aircraft enjoying aviation. While we typically would have no difficulty or safety concerns operating in this environment; this particular day and the lack of ATC services in this environment presented conditions that in my opinion were unsafe due to the differences in size and speed of our aircraft with respect to others operating in the same proximity.I believe the airport could have listed a NOTAM prior to the unscheduled Tower closure that may have informed pilots that the environment was going to become uncontrolled; allowing them to possibly make alternative choices for their operations; and/or plan ahead for standard traffic pattern entry procedures.
Human Factors,Today I was operating as the FO (First Officer) from ZZZ. [The weather] was incredibly clear and quiet so the Captain requested that when I pick up our IFR flight clearance from FSS to request a VFR climb through 17;500 which I did and FSS gave us the VFR climb as requested. I was the Pilot Flying; and as the Captain briefed with me we were doing a left downwind departure. It was also previously briefed that I would depart the left down around the high mountain RCO (Remote Communications Outlet). Upon departure and initial climb the gear was coming up and the Captain called for the left turn. I had planned on waiting a bit longer but looking at the local terrain off my left I saw no risk and making the turn when we did. This departure was completely non-automated and raw data for the way the Captain likes to fly. Truthfully I spent most of my career flying in [this area] so I was not uncomfortable with his techniques. When the left turn was made I did not think or feel that we were at risk of getting a GPWS. Unfortunately as we transited the ridge line we got the audible GPWS warning. We both immediately acknowledged the terrain and that we were not at risk and already passed the ridge. An escape maneuver was not performed due to the daytime VFR weather and the terrain clearance. After leveling off and cruise the Captain and I debriefed the entire event very thoroughly and both agreed the corrective action that we took was reasonable and he thought my lateral spacing was adequate but he was thinking I was climbing faster than I really was. Looking back on the event there are things that could've been done to prevent this event. Better crew communication and waiting a bit longer for the left turn. Flying the full departure would have been the best thing to do. That was not going to be allowed by the Captain but at no time do I believe SOPs were broken. Next time I feel it would be better to fly the full departure and or give the terrain a much larger buffer.
Ambiguous,Go-around due to aircraft ahead on the runway. It didn't clear due to slippery runway conditions. ZZZ indicated we'd be the last to land on [Runway] XXR and then it would close for snow removal. The aircraft which landed ahead of us couldn't make the turn off and stopped. Tower instructed us to go around. We set up and landed on [Runway] XY.
Aircraft,Noticed an acetone/fume smell descending into ZZZ beginning at approximately 1;200 feet AGL. Pack 1 selected off and odor seemed to dissipate.
Aircraft,While on flight X in Aircraft X; we experienced a fume event leveling off at 11;000 ft. The sweet magic marker type smell was noticed by both the Captain and the First Officer. The First Officer continued to fly the aircraft while the Captain began the checklist. A call was made to the Flight Attendants to ascertain if they noticed the smell. One Flight Attendant said that she smelled the same smell in the front galley. It appeared that the smell was dissipating. On short final the odor returned to the Cockpit. The aircraft landed safely in ZZZ without further incident. A logbook entry was made and Maintenance was notified.
Environment - Non Weather Related,First Officer flying ILS approach to Runway 28L in FLL. Autopilot was off. At approximately 50 ft. AGL RA (Radio Altimeter) 1 fault appeared for approximately 3-5 seconds then went away. First Officer continued landing with no adverse effects. Possibly a 5G issue.
Aircraft,The flight departed and everything appeared normal; we landed in ZZZZ no issues in the flight deck. Upon arrival at the gate and after we shut the engines down the APU had just finished its start sequence. We were notified that the flight attendants in the aft of the aircraft smelled dirty sock odor on final. About the same moment my nose felt on fire. I shut the APU bleed down immediately. Fortunately we had a very light customer load; so we had mostly deplaned. By the time I left the flight deck the cleaning crew was on the plane. I had them exit as soon as possibly. Out of an abundance of caution for their safety. We opened all normal exits and flight deck window in an effort to vent the plane. After exiting three of the four flight attendants had bad headaches and [name] complained that their esophagus was burning. I had my First Officer [name] call the Tower for medical assistance; and informed [company] personal on the ground we needed medical assistance. Once the GPU was plugged in I shut the APU down. FO (First Officer) and I remained with our inflight crew provided water for them until the medical personal arrived.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Climbing out of BOS we encountered a brief RA error from possible 5G interference. I did report the event to ATC as well as company via ACARS however neglected to fill out a logbook report. I was under the mistaken impression that since the 5G NOTAM did not take effect until XC00Z; and the event happened at roughly XA00Z that the logbook entry was not required. I have since been counseled and corrected and am clear on the reporting requirements.
Aircraft,On departure from ZZZ at approximately 2000 ft.; the Captain's primary display and navigation display lost all data. This was accompanied by an ADR Fault 1 ECAM. After the completion of all associated checklists and consultation with Dispatch and Maintenance; the decision was made to return to ZZZ. An overweight landing was accomplished.
Environment - Non Weather Related,While waiting to be parked at Gate XX; First Officers RA (radio Altimeter) indication was wildly erratic. Fluctuated between 0 and 2500 ft. continuously for the entire time we waited for a guide man. Returned to normal after taxiing forward to the gate.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On a visual approach to Runway 35R in Orlando; the glide slope did not capture initially. Once on the ground we got a takeoff config warning when clearing the runway with the power barley pushed up. This was reported to ATC; Dispatch and Maintenance. All tests from Maintenance are successful; they think it was a possible 5G anomaly.
Aircraft,FMS/FMC/Autopilot Failure. I looked at the instrumentation to confirm glide slope intercept and immediately recognized that we were descending early. I went to announce it to the CA (Captain) (Pilot Flying) who also recognized the situation at the same time. The aircraft was on autopilot; flying level; with VOR/LOC activated after being cleared for the approach into ZZZ. The aircraft; without being prompted; began to descend before intercepting glide slope at some point. The Captain instantly disconnected the autopilot and auto throttles; initiating a full power climb back to the intercept altitude. We received a call from ATC and received a minor GPWS warning as we were climbing. I feel that crew coordination; confirmation of what the aircraft was supposed to be doing and the reaction by the Pilot Flying (CA) were proper and allowed us to detect the situation early on. Because it was an automation failure; the aircraft will be written up for maintenance.
Aircraft,Due to dirty musty odor Captain decided to refuse airplane. Entry made. Unknown heavy odor throughout the Aircraft Cabin. Since unsure if odor was toxic; Captain decided to refuse airplane.
Aircraft,I was the pilot monitoring and the FO (First Officer) was the Pilot Flying. We were climbing out of 12000 ft. when we heard a loud bang and yawing of the aircraft We got an ECAM alert #1 Engine Stall. We completed the ECAM procedures and as soon as we brought the #1 Thrust Lever to idle; the compressor stalls stopped. We advised ATC that we needed to return to ZZZ.It was just as if we were in training. The FO and I followed our training procedures and everything seemed to flow smoothly. Great CRM between the two of us and ATC did a great job!Nothing we could have done could have prevented this event.
Procedure,On the Janny 5 arrival into BUR on radar vectors off of wabbit. ATC vectored us to cross over the hills/mountains at 5;000 ft. The aircraft gave an aural 'terrain pull up' message and then promptly went away. I saw the RA come down to 1400 ft. which would have caused the warning as the aircraft was in a clean configuration. We were in VMC conditions.Crossing the peaks of the hills/mountains on radar vectors in the clean configuration at 5;000 ft. caused the warning.Maybe the MVA needs to be raised in that location to prevent RA's from occurring. We need 2;000 ft. separation from terrain in mountainous areas and the RA will set off the terrain warning in a clean configuration when less than 1;500 ft. above the ground.
Human Factors,I was in command of Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1. The flight was scheduled to depart out of Gate XX. We boarded; loaded cargo; and received our closeout and paperwork without incident. For the initial pushback clearance; we were instructed to push back tail east; and to drop abeam [Gate] XY. The ground crew was instructed to follow the clearance. In the middle of the pushback; our clearance was amended to push tail south. We noticed that Aircraft Y was on the ABC line facing east in preparation to park at [the gate next to XY]. There was also a company Aircraft Z on the ABD line waiting on further instructions. I amended the instructions to the ground crew in turn. I opted to keep engines off until after the tug was disconnected; it became apparent that the Ramp Controller on frequency was struggling to figure out where to move traffic.As the ground crew signaled for the parking brake to be set; I set the brake and cleared them to disconnect. Seconds later; the Ramp Controller asked us to be pushed further back abeam [Gate] XZ. I rang the ramp horn and flashed the landing light three times to reestablish communications with the ground crew. Note that the parking brake was still set. Once communication was established; I told the crew that Ramp called and wanted us to push further south abeam XZ. I then asked if they had control of the aircraft and were ready for brake release. The Ramper said she had control and was ready for the brake to be released. I released the brake and then verbalized my action. I noticed uncontrolled aircraft movement backwards and the Ramper quickly started that they did not have control. I set the parking brake immediately and stopped the aircraft. I had no reason to believe that contact with any obstacle was made; nor did I have reason to suspect aircraft damage. I made a radio call to Ramp Control that we were trying to sort out communications with the tug crew and we would be pushing back when it was safe to do so. Furthermore; due to the sudden jolt; I made a PA reassuring the passengers that there was a miscommunication during the pushback; everything was fine; and that the jolt was the parking brake being set. I had the FO (First Officer) clarify what the Controllers intentions were; which was to turn into the ABE line; pass [Taxiway]; then exit through Spot XXX. Eventually; proper ground communications were established; we safely released the brake; disconnected; taxied; and completed the flight with no further incident.In my opinion; contributing factors to this incident were a confused ramp controller and either an inexperienced ground crew or one which lacked proper vigilance. Multiple clearance amendments from the Controller had to be relayed to the ground crew; and this only caused confusion for everyone. Needing to reestablish communications after disconnecting the interphone also increased risk. Fortunately I was vigilant in scanning and monitoring the aircraft during the pushback so I could intervene in a timely fashion to avoid damage or injury. At this company; on time performance is heavily emphasized; so I cannot overlook this pressure as a possible factor for everyone involved.The continued emphasis of standard pushback phraseology can never be understated; not just for pilots; but for ground crew as well. On time performance must be tertiary to safety and comfort; respectively. The state of who is in control of the aircraft and the state of the towbar should never be ambiguous; and with that said; no punitive pressure should be on anyone's mind. The consequences are too high for rampers; in addition to airline property; to underemphasize pushback safety. The company has correctly emphasized constant vigilance during pushback and other flight phases via messages and training; and it should continue to do so. Proper training of both ground crew and ramp controllers in high workload situations should made. Emphasis should be made on preventing ramp congestion and conflicts; not managing it. This way indecisive instructions should not have to be made to an aircraft under tow.
Aircraft,Descending into ZZZ we started to smell a hot electrical smell. As we descended on the arrival the smell did not go away and the stab trim started trimming 2 rotations nose down; two rotations nose up. The trim always returned back to its original position. Once we configured flaps 5 the aircraft stopped trimming. There was no abnormality to the way the aircraft was flying. We did not exercise Priority Authority and landed without event. We wrote up issue up and explained to the mechanics what had taken place.
Aircraft,On takeoff; both the FA's (Flight Attendant's) and myself noticed a slight smell in the aft of the aircraft; but it dissipated; so we just thought it was the jet fuel or deicing fluid. We didn't notice any unusual smells during flight. On descent; the smell returned; a lot stronger. It could be smelled in the front of the Cabin; we did go up front and confer with one another to determine if we should call the pilots (it was below 10;000 ft.). We decided to notify them on landing; as the odor was the only concern. As we returned to our jumpseats; the odor got increasingly strong; a mostly a chemical smell (different from the normal jet fuel smell that is common on the Airbus on takeoff and landing). Both myself and the B Flight Attendant felt nauseated and the smell was irritating our throats. I was gagging and almost threw up; and the B Flight Attendant said her throat felt tight and she also felt nauseated. After we disarmed our doors; I went to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up. My head started throbbing and I felt very nauseated and throat felt tight. I called the Flight Deck to notify them of the incident. They didn't smell the same odor; but came back to assess; and then we all got off the aircraft so we could get some fresh air. We stood in the jetway; the B Flight Attendant and I kept feeling increasingly worse. My head felt foggy and I was very nauseated. The Captain suggested I use the pilot oxygen; as I was feeling pretty bad; (my eyes were closed but going back and forth uncontrollably). So I went into the Flight Deck and used the Pilot Oxygen. That did help a bit. After conferring as a crew and with the CSA's (Customer Service Agent); the CSA's called the paramedics. The A FA and the C FA made most attempts at the list of Air Quality contacts. Services wanted us to evacuate the jetway and get away from the aircraft; so we went into the terminal. As the paramedics evaluated us; we attempted on multiple phones to get in contact with MedAire. The A FA got a hold of someone first; and that person told the A FA that we each individually had to call on a separate phone call to speak with someone. The B FA & I waited on hold for 45 minutes; and were not successful in getting a hold of anyone to be cleared. In the meantime; the Chief Pilot gave the ok for us to be transported to the hospital (since we couldn't get a hold of anyone). This whole process of 'being cleared' to go to the ER took over an hour. Eventually the 3 Flight Attendants were transported to the Hospital by ambulance.
Aircraft,Aircraft X departed ZZZ on DATE on the climbout we experienced an engine shut down which resulted in some fire coming out of the engine. The Captain informed us we would be turning around and landing in ZZZ where we would be meet by Personal and then we would be going back to the terminal where we would then have maintenance look at the aircraft. After landing they determined we would need to switch aircraft so they found us another plane we boarded waited for fuel then we departed for ZZZ1.
Procedure,On Date I was assigned to the fuel nozzle mod on the Left Engine; Aircraft X. I documented the MPNs and SNs of the removed fuel nozzles on card number 1 as well as 5 non-routines; NR1; NR2; NR3; NR4; and NR5. On Date1; a week later; Stores Manager notified me that I documented the wrong MPNs and SNs. The fuel nozzles were never shipped out to the vendor. Instead; used fuel components sat in ZZZ Stores for a week. He also stated that only I can correct the info on the unserviceable tags. Since there is no signature or stamp on the unserviceable tag; his instruction was diametrically false. Any stock clerk could make the corrections on the unserviceable tag. I asked Stores to print new unserviceable tags using the existing tracking #. They said it was impossible because all 18 fuel nozzles were received. The resultant corrections on the unserviceable tags made the document almost unreadable. Since the error was pointed out to me; I had to void and correct the rotatable parts info on the aforementioned non-routines. Then I had the clerk rescan the non-routines to the software. However; the non-routines could not be reopened in a different program to update the parts info. Ergo; I had to file a message.The paperwork burden on the mechanic is overwhelming and a distraction from the actual work. If Stores can process parts after discovering an error why is the mechanic's participation even required? Encumbering mechanics with needless administrative work is a distraction which ultimately leads to human errors. The overwhelming paperwork saddled onto mechanics is leading to an unsafe environment; parts entry into the program; Technical Service Items with unreadable language; documentation that is worse than an MIT entrance exam; etc. All taking the mechanic's critical attention away from the actual maintenance.
Aircraft,Descending through 4;000 ft. the Captain and I smelled a 'dirty socks' smell in the flight deck; but there was also a slight chemical smell to it. I began to feel a tingling sensation in my hands and so I donned my oxygen mask. I was leveling at 3;000 ft. and turning base to final to land on the ILS for XXL. While on oxygen; I felt fit to continue to flying the aircraft and landed normally. I stayed on oxygen until engine shutdown at the Gate. The smell continued on the taxi and lingered after engine shutdown. The Flight Attendants could not smell the odor in the cabin. After I left the aircraft; while walking up the jet bridge my hands; feet; and lips continued to feel tingly and I had a light headed sensation. I elected to go to the ER where my bloodwork confirmed my carbon monoxide levels were slightly elevated. I believe that the fume problem was caused by engine oil contaminants in the bleed air system. However; maintenance could not duplicate the issue and the airplane was returned to service. This type of fume incident is not uncommon throughout the industry and needs to be reported on FAA Service Difficulty Reports to ensure that the industry and manufactures improve the filtration systems on aircraft; install carbon monoxide or other sensors to detect air quality issues; and to develop standardized protocols for physicians to follow when crew members encounter fume events. The health of crew members and the safety of flight is impacted by these fume events and it needs to be corrected.
Human Factors,On approach to Runway 26R we were assigned 170 kts to AJAAY. We were behind a Boeing 767 and were closing on him. We started to get into his wake turbulence. At about two and a half miles behind the Boeing 767 we started to slow. As a result; we began to slow before AJAAY. I should have told Tower we needed to slow due to spacing and wake turbulence.
Ambiguous,While flying [the] visual approach backed up by ILS35R MCO at 1600 feet MSL the glide slope failed to capture even though we had a good signal. We started down in V/S and at approximately 1400 feet MSL the glide slope captured. Approach and landing were normal after that point.Additionally; after turning off [the] runway; the Takeoff Warning Horn sounded twice when I attempted to add power to taxi. The warning then ceased.The radio altimeters appeared to display normally.Notified Dispatch and Maintenance.
Software and Automation,After flying from ZZZZ to ZZZZ1 and preparing to return to ZZZZ; We learned that the entire data link system for the airline had been down for 1 hour; and would stay out for an undetermined amount of time. Apparently; this was night 1 of three days that the system was to be purposely down for maintenance of some sort. While the timing worked well for the US/domestic operation (middle of the night); it was right in the middle of the day for the [foreign] operations. The aircraft would not 'Auto Initialize'; which of course; begins the sequence of automatic data links to the aircraft. After a crew discussion; the consensus was to manually input the route.The entire crew was present; and coordinated the correct loading of the route. It was then discussed; that the weights would not data link; as well as any performance information. Ultimately; we were shut down until the data link came back up. Eventually; the system slowly returned; but in a very reduced capacity. The auto init function was utilized; as well as all the performance information: the predicted takeoff data; final weights; and final takeoff data. As a side note; the flying FO (First Officer); did the load at the gate; and the final load after engine start. After a normal takeoff and climb; FO went to crew rest; as he was the Flying Pilot. FO relief pilot took the right seat. Near the fir boundary; at cruise altitude; the Center Controller told us that the ADS-B info did not match our flight number. The language barrier was significant; as this was not a typical ATC conversation; and several attempts were made to confirm what the problem was. After investigating several areas where we may have had a disconnect; I believe that we realized the flight number that would normally have data-linked to the route page was empty. We then consulted the [stored information] to determine the correct format for that input. Initially; I believe we input Aircraft Y; rather than Aircraft X. After the flight info was input; we received no other notification of the flight number mismatch; and assumed that the problem had been corrected. It is my understanding that was the case. In any case; the system reset caused us a great deal of trouble; both here and three days later when conducting the last flight of the trip pairing. Automation is a sensational thing when it works correctly.
Human Factors,I was Pilot Flying and the Captain was Pilot Monitoring. We were cleared to land Runway 04R in HNL. After touching down and rolling out; the HNL Tower cleared us to cross Runway 08L at Kilo and contact Ground when clear of the runway. The Captain asked the Tower a second time; 'confirm cleared to cross Runway 08L?' since this is identified as Hot-Spot 2 at HNL. The Tower again confirmed we were cleared to cross 08L and contact Ground when clear of the runway. At this point we made a positive exchange of the flight controls and the Captain took control of the aircraft. Taxiway Kilo has an element of high-speed entry from Runway 04R and we were slowed from rollout; but still moving at a reasonable taxi speed when we came to the Kilo taxiway hold short line of Runway 08L. As we individually looked to 'clear' the right and left sides of the runway before taxiing onto Runway 08L; the Captain observed an Aircraft Y approximately 200 feet above the approach end of Runway 08L. Once identified we both looked and confirmed that the Aircraft Y was landing on Runway 08L. The Captain attempted to stop the aircraft; but he was unable too; before the nose of the aircraft entered Runway 08L. The Captain then pushed the thrust levers forward to propel us across Runway 08L; and clear of Runway 08L; before the Aircraft Y touched down on Runway 08L. There was no further incident.High workload; positive exchange of flight controls; speed at which we entered Taxiway Kilo; ATC commands; and the angle of our view of Runway 08L were all contributing factors. Ultimately we should have stopped the aircraft before entering Runway 08L; even though the HNL Tower had cleared us to cross the runway. Taxiway Kilo and Runway 08L intersection is already identified as Hot Spot 2 at HNL. We were aware of a threat but what we didn't consider was HNL Tower being 'wrong' to clear us to cross the runway with an aircraft on short final.
Procedure,It was night with freezing fog and visibility in the low RVRs. After de-icing / anti-icing and checklists complete; I was in contact with the ground crew at parking spot XX. He had me release the brakes to move the airplane; straighten the nose and remove chocks. We felt the airplane move backward and jerk heavily side to side. We were under tow. Ground crew cleared us to start all engines. I confirmed starting engines 4 and 1; he confirmed it is clear. After these started; I confirmed starting engines 2 and 3; and he confirmed it is clear. Engine 3 failed to start. I called for the immediate action items for the EICAS message ENG 3 AUTO START; and immediately after that for the QRH. While the FO (First Officer) was reading the QRH the ground crew interrupted and said we had 4 good engine starts. I immediately responded Negative; engine 3 did not start. I repeated it a few times but no answer. Now we saw the airplane start to move forward slowly. I urgently called the ground crew again because I did not want to step on the brakes while we were under tow and cause extensive damage. There was no answer so I brought the airplane to a stop on taxiway 1 in front of our parking spot. I continued calling the ground crew and flashed the lights to signal the ground crew; and they gave us hand signals to turn off the engines. After connecting to the interphone; the ground crew informed us that a cart bounced the exhaust cone of engine 3. After we pushed back to the parking spot and exited the airplane we saw the scrape on the engine 3 tail cone. In conclusion; we all thought we were under tow because the airplane was moved to remove chocks and straighten the nose wheel; and the slope is also slightly downhill.  The ground crew did not say to set the parking brake; he just cleared us to start engines; so we rightfully thought we were still connected to the tug. The ramp was icy and another 747 had to be towed into a spot in front of us after sliding on the ramp. I was dealing with the engine malfunction and emergency checklist and calling the ground crew when we saw the airplane move and brought it to a stop. A lot was happening at the same time and it can occupy one's attention. Everything was giving us the assurance that we were under tow. Clear instructions need be communicated to the flight crew if towing will be used or not be used; especially in situations of inclement weather; poor visibility and at night. I suggest that when cleared to start engines; the crew always be directed to set the parking brake. It is imperative that ALL objects in front of the engines; wings and airplane be removed before starting engines; not after. This would have prevented this mishap.
Environment - Non Weather Related,We were set to execute the ILS 28C which is what the ATIS was reporting. After contacting Chicago Approach; they informed us to expect the RNAV (GPS) 27R. We updated the FMS with RNAV 27R and briefed the approach. VOR updating was turned off. While on Radar vectors; we were given Direct Welev to join the Final for 27R. After joining the final; I notice that my LNAV was indicated full left defection. The VNAV was full up defection; which would be normal since we were below the crossing altitude.At this point; I heard ATC questioning the aircraft ahead of us about their tracking. I took a look at [the] First Officer indication and saw no LNAV/VNAV indication. We both were baffled and could not figure it out. While discussing the matter with FO; aircraft ahead of us did a go around. Shortly after that; we did the same and requested the ILS 28C. Rest of the flight was uneventful; ILS 28C was executed with no issues. After further discussion with FO; we determined that we were perfectly setup for the RNAV 27R approach. Not only did the aircraft ahead of us go around; but so did the aircraft behind us. ATC called me to ask what occurred. I told them what is on this report. They were not sure as to the problem with this approach. ATC controller asked if I thought this was related to 5G. I told him that I did not know.
Aircraft,On short final; first officer was flying. An uncommanded Annunciation 'priority right' for the First Officer side stick occurred; immediately followed by another annunciation of the same and an uncommanded increase in thrust. I took control of the aircraft at this time; assigned side stick priority to my side; disconnected auto thrust; and executed a go-around as the approach was no longer stable per company policy. The aircraft then functioned normally and a normal approach and landing was accomplished and maintenance informed of the anomaly.
Airport,We were cleared to taxi to Runway 2L via Alpha and to hold short. The taxiway was mostly bare and dry; as we got down further towards intersection Foxtrot and Golf the taxiway was now compacted snow. I started slowing the airplane and as we got closer to the hold line my co-pilot asked me if I saw the hold line as it was partially obscured by the snow. I answered 'Yes' and started to brake further and then the aircraft started to slide. The co-pilot then asked me again if I saw the hold line and I said 'Yes' but I have no control the braking action was nil; at that point all I could do was to steer the aircraft to the left towards the runway and was able to get it stopped; but we had slid past the hold line by maybe 10-20 ft. My co-pilot informed the Tower that we were unable to stop and had gone past the hold line. The Tower instructed a go-around for the aircraft on final which they were probably 3 miles out. The Tower then cleared us for takeoff and asked us again if the reason we weren't able to stop was because of the braking action and we responded affirmative. We told the Tower that we were sorry we could not stop because of the braking action being nil and he responded that these things happen. The rest was uneventful.
Aircraft,We pre-diverted to ZZZ before leaving ZZZ2 because ZZZ1 weather was below minimums to dispatch. At the top of descent; Captain flying; the Captain's airspeed started to roll back and the auto throttles started to move forward as the aircraft started down. We subsequently received 'IAS disagree' annunciations. Captain performed the memory items for airspeed unreliable and we leveled out. As a crew we determined that the FO (First Officer) and standby airspeed were matched; and asked ATC to confirm our ground speed because the wind readout seemed erroneous. We maintained our filed route. We advised ATC; maintained our filed route and continued to ZZZ. ZZZ1 was not an option with the 1/16 mile reported fog. We did not feel comfortable returning to ZZZ2 with the severity of the situation; not knowing if the FO's side would possibly fail. We had to manage the QRH; start down; [and] change the approach from the RNP to the LDA as we would have 1 FD for the approach. While continuing the descent the Captain's airspeed bled to 45 kts. and the airplane cycled through its aural warnings but we never received the stick shaker. While on the arrival and approach the weather was fluctuating from 10SM to 1 3/4 due to a fog bank. The rapidly changing weather conditions were not helpful but we prepared for a possible go around by briefing the go around pitch and power settings. We were able to pick up the field about 6 miles out and landed uneventfully with the FO flying.We have practiced this scenario in the simulator [which] provided valuable experience to deal with the scenario in real life.
Human Factors,Going into BHM I was the Pilot Monitoring. Weather conditions were clear; but winds were gusty; making for a bumpy ride in the descent. After I obtained the ATIS; the Captain and I planned and briefed for the Visual 24; backed up with the ILS. Winds were 320@11 and runways 24 and 36 were in use at the airport. The altimeter setting was 30.18.Upon contacting Approach; we found out the current winds were 330@16 with gusts of 28 kts. We discussed the winds and determined we were getting close; but still within limits of landing Runway 24. Around leveling off at 3000 ft.; Approach informed us that the winds had shifted to 350@15 G25 and that they were now landing runways 06 and 36. We opted for the Visual 36 since the winds were favoring that runway and we already had the landing data.We briefed and discussed the particular threats for the Visual 36; which was going to be backed up with the RNAV 36. Along with it being a night landing; we recognized we would not have a GS and PAPI; and we were aware that BHM has surrounding terrain which can pose a hazard. When Approach offered to give us vectors for a 10 mile final for 36; we gladly accepted to help eliminate the terrain risk and set up for a stabilized approach.We were vectored in to intercept the final prior to IMOBY. Once cleared for the Visual 36; we descended to the crossing altitude of 2800 ft. The next waypoint on the approach was BERFY; which was the FAF and had a crossing altitude of 2300 ft. We crossed that waypoint on profile; set the DDA altitude; and continued down at 800fpm. Right after the 1;000 ft. call out; the GRD PROX switch light illuminated. We might have been slightly below snowflake; but seemed on profile. We did not get any aural warnings. Around the same time; Tower informed us of a low altitude alert. At that point the Captain initiated a go-around. Once stabilized; we set up the approach; and landed Runway 06 with no further issues.
Incorrect / Not Installed / Unavailable Part,Aircraft X arrived t the gate with the clamp missing on keel beam APU duct pressure seal. After further inspection; I found that the clamp had slipped off AND WAS NOT MISSING. The aircraft was taken out of service because of the lengthy time required to correct this issue. This can lead to potential pressurization issues and leaks. There have been several other aircraft seen with the same issue.
Human Factors,One coll. [package] is smelling of petrol and the package is damp due to spillage.No [Dangerous Goods] have been declared.[Company Name] Warehouse has insulated the package.The package was on [Airways Bill] XXXXX.
Human Factors,I was working the final to SNA airport; TUSTIN sector; frequency 121.3. Aircraft X was on a heading 100 at 3;000 MSL on the base. When I reached out to Aircraft X to vector him right turn heading 170 to intercept the localizer Aircraft X was no longer on my frequency. Aircraft X not responding and continuing on heading 100 I reached out to Aircraft X again turning him right heading 270 to join the final. He was no longer on my frequency proceeding towards high MVA of 3;700 followed by 4;400 MVA. I jumped on guard frequency to try to get hold of him; I reached out to SNA Tower whether they had him on frequency and in case they did to give them immediate right turn heading 250 and climbing to 4;000 towards lower terrain and away from proceeding descending traffic from the NE. At the same time all other sectors in the area were trying to reach out to Aircraft X. It is unknown how Aircraft X ended up on SNA Tower frequency and how long he was on their frequency but eventually SNA Tower was instructed to give Aircraft X westbound heading 270 and climb to 5;000 while Aircraft X was in 4;400 MVA at 3;000 still on a heading 100. Aircraft X was also instructed by Tower then to contact approach PACIFIC sector on 128.1.From the Controller point of view I would just recommend extreme vigilance from pilots especially when put on a base. If pilot knows he is flying through the localizer without being told to expect vector to the final across the localizer; he should question that and reach out to someone right away. Especially if he hears the phrase 'clear to land'. That instruction is a Tower responsibility only. If pilot hears that on frequency while thinking he is on approach frequency or any other frequency but Tower; he should follow up and look for solutions immediately.
Human Factors,I was FO (First Officer) for this flight; and we were to depart out of Gate XX from ZZZ. The crew accomplished our pre-flight duties and closed out as usual. As FO I called Ramp Control for pushback and received instruction to pushback tail to the East abeam Gate XY. The CA (Captain) relayed this to our ramp crew; and we began our pushback. During the push; Ramp Control issued us new pushback instructions to now face our tail to the South. I readback the instructions and CA relayed this to our rampers. Normally I listen to the ground crew along with CA; however ramp frequency was congested; and I could tell that the Ramp Controller was becoming increasingly unsure of how to facilitate traffic in/out of our ramp; so I opted to focus Ramp Control and was not listening to the ground crew with CA. We completed our pushback and as our ground crew was disconnecting; Ramp Control called with further amended instructions to now pushback to Gate XY. CA signaled to the ground crew; re-established communications with them and relayed our amended push instructions. CA asked if ground crew were connected and ready for the brake to be released and I heard CA confirm ground crew's apparent control of the aircraft and that they were ready for the brake to be released and he then said he was releasing the brake (note I was not listening to the ground crew so I could only hear CA's communication to them). After CA released the brake; the aircraft began to slowly roll backwards and both of us recognized this as uncontrolled aircraft movement and that the ground crew tug was not connected to the aircraft. CA took swift corrective action by setting the parking brake; and aircraft movement stopped. I heard CA query the ground crew about the status of their connection to the aircraft and requested better communication from the ground crew as to their status of aircraft control. CA made a PA to the passengers stating the reason for the sudden stop and that everything was now under control. The ground crew re-connected to the aircraft; resumed pushback; and the flight continued safely to our destination without incident.It was apparent that Ramp Control was struggling to facilitate aircraft movement in and out of the ramp with arriving aircraft awaiting our push to continue to their gates. This resulted in multiple amendments to our pushback instructions; the last of which came as ground crew had already disconnected from the aircraft. This could have confused our ground crew and lead to their apparent miscommunication to CA regarding the status of their connection to the aircraft and readiness for our brake to be released.When possible; avoiding situations where pushback tugs need to be disconnected and then reconnected could prevent ground crew confusion as occurred with our flight. Also as an FO; staying aware of what is occurring during the pushback; even if having to frequently communicate with a saturated Ramp Control during the push; is essential in the potential event that the CA does not notice uncontrolled aircraft movement so that you can step in and take corrective action if needed.
Environment - Non Weather Related,While cruising at FL320; I noticed the 'APPR 2 NOT AVAILABLE' advisory repeatedly showing up on ICAS; followed by the ALT flag on my Primary Flight Display (I was the pilot flying). We were enroute via Q40 in the vicinity of Meridian (MEI). This message called for 'crew awareness ' in accordance with our Quick Reference Handbook. For a few seconds we began to experience altitude variations on the plus and minus sides thus making it impossible to maintain assigned altitude. I asked [the Captain] to request a lower altitude so we could leave RVSM in view of the problem we were experiencing. We were cleared to FL280 and although the advisory would show up once more; the aircraft maintained altitude and no further issues appeared.Shortly after; we heard on the radio another aircraft also requesting altitude change as they could not maintain their assigned altitude either; in the same area we experienced our problem. A few moments later; we heard a [a third] flight asking the Controller if he had knowledge of any problems in that area as they lost their Autopilot and several others systems and were unable to maintain altitude. I think that same flight landed after us and there were firetrucks waiting for its arrival.We discussed the problem during the flight and wondered if this issue was related to a 5G network implementation or something similar. We don't know. I noticed in the area around the fix MISLE; there are several tall antennas; around the area we had this problem. Perhaps look into this 5G network issue more closely and how it possibly affects aircraft at high altitude.
Ambiguous,While on a visual approach to Runway 09R; backed up with the ILS 09R-Z approach; we got a 'NAV RA 1 FAULT' message 2 nm west of KELEE intersection. Both radio altimeters appeared to be operating normally and displaying accurate information. The approach was continued to a manual landing without incident. Turn off 5G cell service near airports.
Aircraft,On the descent into ZZZZ passing approx 7-10k ft. and passing through a moisture layer; a very strong chemical odor similar to paint entered the cockpit. I immediately had several physiological responses to include dizziness; brain fog; muscle fatigue; and a tingling sensation throughout my body. The event lasted approx 30-45 seconds. I contacted Med on the ground and they directed me to get a medical evaluation at a local clinic. I returned from the clinic and tried to get some rest for the night but a general feeling of unwellness and anxiety kept me up half the night. I decided the safest course of action would be to call out mid pairing sick for my return leg.
Ambiguous,We were cleared directly to BENNG roughly 20 miles out by Approach. The approach is a Non-Autopilot coupled approach (ILS 04 LGA) so the Captain being Pilot Flying set up the aircraft earlier than normal to insure we would be stable when needed. Shortly after turning inbound we switched over to Tower and simultaneously the throttle rolled back to the point that if left alone the aircraft would be in an undesired state. The Captain attempted to ease the throttle up to see if it would mitigate the situation but it didn't. He proceeded to turn them off all the automation and I monitored closely the instruments while doing my flows and call outs; I advised the speed fluctuations verbally 'speed increasing/decreasing.'Due-to the 5G network in the area and active NOTAM in the ATIS I was being extra vigilant with my focus on the aircraft instruments. We were configured and stable at my 1000 ft. and 500 ft. call outs and continued on the approach to land. After landing; Tower gave us directions to turn off and go ground. While turning off we noticed the landing light was still off giving us the cue that we may have missed the landing clearance. Tower gave us instructions to taxi off the runway per normal operation; and at no point did Tower or Ground advise that there was an issues; and nothing further was said to us. Verify landing light on. Clearance received at 1000 ft. configured call.
Ambiguous,While on a visual approach to Runway 26 at 1755L; at approximately a 2.5 NM mile final; and during the rest of the approach; both RADAR altimeters (RA) started fluctuating and we received RA caution messages along with EFIS COMP MON caution messages. While EFIS COMP MON is not uncommon; they seemed to coexist with the RA cautions.
Weather,Heavy snow on arrival; landing and taxi in okay. Gate area was partially plowed; however when given stop signal by line person the aircraft continued moving. Both pilots applied full braking and parking brake was set to no avail. Cycled reverse thrust several times to stop aircraft. Managed to stop before hitting any ground gear. Airport was completely covered in snow; weather was low Runway Visual Range around 2500-3000ft. All surfaces very slick. We were moving very slowly and deliberately; obviously the ramp area was much slicker than I anticipated. Should have tried stopping before the signal.
Ambiguous,Approximately 3 to 5 mile final on a Visual Approach to Runway 6; noticed intermittent 'TCAS' displayed on PFD. Unknown whether any targets displayed on ND. After landing; the following aircraft reported the anomaly to ATC stating that ' the same anomaly was occurring that he had seen the previous day.' At that point we notified ATC of our event. At no time did we suspect system failure or a 5G event. This was our second landing on that runway of the day and we did not see the anomaly on the previous approach.
Ambiguous,We were visual with the runway and flying the ILS Z 16R; after Glideslope intercept; the Localizer course in the HUD started to flutter from side to side but never lost signal. At approximately 200 ft. the Radio altimeter in the HUD also blinked a few times; but never lost signal. All altitude call outs were normal; 100; 50; 40; 30 20 10 ft. I did not write up anything in the AML; but did contact Tower to relay what we experienced to see if they were having any issues with the ILS. At no time did I feel the approach was unstable or not safe because we were VFR with the runway. However; given the 5G issues; If we were flying a CAT III approach I would have executed a GO AROUND because the ILS signal did appear slightly unstable. This is a hard event to describe because no instrument failures or equipment failures occurred. It just wasn't normal! The ILS signal appeared slightly unstable; but reliable. Again we were VFR so continued the approach.  The fluttering from side to side was no more then 2 degrees. A better word to describe the fluttering maybe vibrating from side to side in a rapid motion all the time staying within the localizer course. The blinking of the Radio Altimeter was also rapid and less then a second between and only happened a couple of times. First Officer as far as I can recall did not notice anything on the Dual Cue or the PFD. Only in the HUD. It just wasn't normal. No real suggestions because I cannot point to an instrument or signal failure. It just wasn't normal. But at no time was it unsafe.
Human Factors,While assigned to Aircraft X operating ZZZ - ZZZ1; I learned the aircraft had Accessible Dangerous Goods (ADG) on board that we had not been advised of as flight crew and was not reflected in the Aircraft Dangerous Goods Manifest. We were told of the error the evening after the flight landed in ZZZ1. We were later told that the [type] Dangerous Goods Container had ADG present; the Dangerous Goods was tied down and a DG ID Tag was in the container pouch; and the Unit Load Devise DG Manifest was also located in the container pouch rather than the DG Paper Envelope provided to the flight crew before departure from ZZZ. During our pre-departure procedures; we were provided two ULD DG Manifests for positions 4 and 5; and no ADG Manifest was provided. We later learned there was Class 3 and 8 Dangerous Goods in the [type] DG Container. [This discrepancy was caused by] Improperly manifested DG by DG personnel. [Reporter suggested the company] Implement cross-check process for DG personnel to follow. Have DG personnel include a check of accessible DG container even when DG manifest does not indicate it being present.
Ambiguous,At approximately 1000 ft. just outside 3 miles in VMC to Runway 8 at JAX; the First Officer's radio altimeter intermittently would go out (was replaced by an amber RA) and then come back. The Captain's radio altimeter worked the entire time. We also had our Autoland Status indicator go blank. It had previously shown a green Land 3 indication. JAX does have a 5G NOTAM for Runway 08; but we also have a Alternate Means of Compliance approved for all runways at JAX. 5G?
Ambiguous,At approximately 200 ft. AGL on an autopilot off approach to DFW; we received multiple alerts most of which were too brief to decipher. One that we did catch was 'use manual spoilers'. Since auto spoilers rely on the radio altimeters we suspected 5G interference. The alerts were brief and all systems appeared to work normally during the landing. We were not able to analyze this until after the flight; therefore; Tower was not notified.
Ambiguous,[There was] possible 5G interference. [I was] flying a visual approach backed up with the RNAV RNP Runway 16L; between WORTH and URATE; fully configured for landing. LNAV and VNAV were both engaged and performing normally. Then just before URATE; VNAV suddenly showed us below the PATH; although the Flight Mode Annunciator was showing VNAV PATH. The auto throttles added thrust and we could visually see that VNAV was getting the aircraft high on the PAPI. I disconnected the autopilot and auto throttles and hand flew the aircraft using V/S mode and the heads-up display. I didn't notice any abnormal Radio Altimeter indications.
Human Factors,The difference between this flight and a LOFT is that in a LOFT; we know when it is going to end because there's an end to the SIM availability. In retrospect; this was a case study in additive conditions. Planned at [Allowable Takeoff Gross] minus 100# with a short flight and an alternate. Attempting to accommodate a Jumpseater; HAZMAT; multiple releases; I traded into the leg to help a fellow Pilot. Unusual day; because of incoming weather. The last two days of my trip were pulled; due to cancellations. Requirement to burn fuel; prior to push; ZFW issues; OTP pressures; I was notified; in passing; that there was HAZMAT on the flight; during a conversation with the Operations Agent and Dispatcher about [Allowable Takeoff Gross] and ZFW issues. The amendment to add the HAZMAT was sent via ACARS. After departure; I realized that I had not received a [Dangerous Goods Form]. I seem to remember that the HAZMAT was pulled; but cannot say for certain. If that was the case; then I should have amended the Release to remove the note for HAZMAT. If the HAZMAT was still on; I failed to ensure the [Dangerous Goods Form] was delivered to the cockpit and in the logbook.
Aircraft,After takeoff the electric trim no longer worked. We tried both PF (Pilot Flying) and PNF (Pilot not Flying) side to make sure. We followed the QRH and worked the problem with the QRH. CA (Captain) transferred controls to me while the CA got together with Dispatch; Flight Attendants and ATC for our return to ZZZZ. We could manually trim the airplane for the return flight and uneventful landing back in ZZZZ. [Priority handling was requested]. The CRM between the whole crew and ATC was great.
Ambiguous,Holding short of Runway 27 IAH Aircraft Y reported 5G interference with flight instruments. We were cleared for takeoff and climbing through 400 ft. the mode control panel altitude window indicated 50;000 ft. on its own and the altitude alerter sounding continuously. I selected level change due to VNAV dropping offline and the absence of the flight director pitch bar. Upon re-selecting the cleared altitude in the altitude window the pitch bar was restored and VNAV was re-selected as the pitch mode. This event was reported to ATC; Dispatch; and an ELB entry was entered.
Aircraft,While operating Aircraft X ZZZ-ZZZ1; at approximately FL310; and approximately 50 miles NW of ZZZZZ intersection; we notice a slight flicker from the master caution light that immediately extinguished. A few minutes later the light illuminated again. At this point we were able to determine it was the OVHT/DET indication on the recall pad. Indication remained for only a few seconds then extinguished again. All engine indications were normal. A short time later the engine fire warning system illuminated along with the fire warning bell. The number one engine light was illuminated. This indication only lasted for about 2 seconds then extinguished. Again; all engine indications appeared normal. I directed the First Officer to fly the airplane and communicated with ATC while I reviewed the engine fire checklist. At this point however; all indications were normal. Considering all factors; including destination; night time; sporadic and intermittent nature of the warnings; I elected to return to ZZZ after conferring with my First Officer. We elected to accept an overweight landing rather than risk the warning returning during a hold while trying to burn fuel. After reviewing the overweight landing procedure we elected to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ. Approach and arrival was fully briefed; Flight Attendants were advised of the situation; as well as passengers. I elected to perform the landing as my First Officer was on his second day of IOE. I then took control of the aircraft and landed on Runway XXR. Landing weight was approximately 154;000 lbs; and landing was very soft. After turning off runway we stopped and had crash fire/rescue visually confirm there were no fire indications either with brakes or engines. We then proceed to the gate and deplaned normally. All defects were submitted via ACARS ELB.
Ambiguous,While cruising at FL390 about 20 miles NE of CLT had a possible 5G interference with our radar altimeter. Radar altimeter displayed for about 45 seconds to a minute and showed fluctuations between 1;400-1;790 [ft.] AGL. This also caused the aircraft to think it was close to the ground and displayed the landing ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) instructing that the plane wanted the gear and flaps down as well as the spoilers to be armed. The anomaly went away after about a minute. Per our pilot bulletin we notified ATC; Dispatch; Operations; and made a Maintenance write up.
Aircraft,Shortly after takeoff we noticed an odor in the cockpit.  Thinking it might be the ENG ANT-ICE we continued flying the SID.  (We could not turn it off because of icing conditions). About 7;000 ft. the FA's (Flight Attendants) called the cockpit telling us they smelt it too. After talking to Dispatch; Maintenance Operations Manager and the FA's we decided to return to ZZZ. The odor lasted all the way back to the gate until Eng shut down. At the gate APU air was then used and was odorless.A Faulty Aircraft System causing the odor. Prevention would be an aircraft design/maintenance issue.
Human Factors,Airplane had multiple write ups - one of which was an inop pack #2. Maintenance worked on and cleared a recurring smoke detector fault which delayed flight. The isolation valve was off and there was some discussion with Maintenance as to why it was turned off. After looking at MEL; we turned it back on. At some point during that discussion; the mechanic turned off the #1 pack. The #2 pack was left on. On taxi out (I think); we had ECAM that required us to turn off the isolation valve which we did. After departure we had several other ECAMs as well as the autopilot disconnecting several times. If I remember correctly they were: some flight control ECAM that flashed on with MW and then went away; another ECAM with smoke and air that also went away; smoke detector fault; and auto flight/autopilot with MW (Master Warning). Around FL270; CA (Captain) notices cabin altitude was 9;500 ft. We asked for 21;000 ft. initially and started descent. During the descent we got the CAB PR EXCESS/CAB ALT MW. We [requested priority handling]; donned oxygen masks and initiated an emergency descent to 10;000 ft. During the descent the airplane was in an over speed state twice. The PF (Pilot Flying) choose not to use autopilot as it was not staying connected. We were not over max landing weight and had a normal landing in ZZZ. The oxygen masks never deployed. The cabin altitude got to around 10;300 ft. at the highest. Classic hurry up and wait and then hurry up and go. Maintenance said plane probably will be out of service. I was already going to next plane in my head. Then; plane was fixed; 30ish people boarded and everyone was ready but us. We even went through MELs twice. Obviously we didn't pay attention to important details of which pack/valve we were talking about. I wish I had an answer for that as to why we didn't catch it. Slow down; repeat -Just like we do with engine masters; throttles; etc. I need to say out loud pack #2 and confirm pack #2 not just inoperative pack because it was too easy to look up and see that 'a' pack was off (even though it was the incorrect pack).
Aircraft,We were cruising at FL360 when we felt several jolts coming from what appeared to be the #2 engine. We then encountered what felt like a strong vibration from the right side as well. At almost the same time that this was happening we received a call from the Flight Attendants who reported hearing loud banging coming from the right side of the aircraft. The only indication from the engine instruments that we observed was the N1 on the #2 engine dropping to approximately 54%. I was the Pilot Flying and disengaged the auto throttles and pulled the #2 thrust lever back until the vibration ceased which was when the thrust lever was at idle. The banging and vibration stopped and the engine seemed to have no further problems at idle. I did attempt one time to increase the thrust but felt the vibration return almost immediately; so I returned it to idle. We [advised] ATC and found that ZZZ was the nearest suitable airport. We requested a lower altitude and were given lower and vectors for ZZZ. I continued to fly the aircraft and the Captain ran the appropriate checklists and coordinated with ATC; Dispatch; the Flight Attendants and Passengers. We requested that ARFF meet us on the runway to inspect the engine. I flew a single engine visual approach to Runway XX at ZZZ and backed it up with the ILS. We stopped the aircraft on the runway and set the brakes. The Captain made the PA to remain seated and AARF came and checked the engine for visible damage or fire. None was detected; so we secured the engine and performed a single engine taxi to the gate with AARF in tow. The passengers were able to deplane via jet bridge. I do not think anything other than the maintenance issue caused the event or my role in the event. I do not think that anything can be done to prevent events like this.
Aircraft,Leaving ZZZ to ZZZ1. After take off; Captain did an all-call to ask if we smell something unusual. All Fa's (Flight Attendants) said yes. Captain asked if any of us have experienced fumes in a cabin before and none of the working crew have but the jumpseater seated by 1L have and that jumpseater said it smells exactly like fumes from the plane. Captain then was checking in on us to see if he should have the plane turn around. I'm not sure how his decision making process was but we ended up continuing with the flight.  Later into the flight; Captain called us (all-call) to ask each FA for what symptoms we were having. All Fa's got a headache; #4 got watery eyes as well; #3 had a weird taste on his lips. Eventually once more leveled off from take-off; the smell dissipated. However; as we were about to land; I started smelling the same fume scent again and when we were taxiing into our gate in ZZZ1; I called all FA's to see if they were smelling the fumes again. #4 said she was definitely smelling it again. I was not sure what the #3 said or the #1 said. When we got to the gate; I believe the smell was gone or not as bad anymore. After all passengers deplaned; as I was walking out of the plane; I passed by 3L 3R and all of a sudden a strong smell of the fumes again. I [could] see Maintenance was on board and left to head to operations with FA #1. We talked to Maintenance Operations Manager to see what we can do. We asked them to give us information of an urgent care address and how to go about with a report.
Procedure,Aircraft X requested [Runway] 3 for departure. Volume wise we determined it better for [Runway] 8; so Ground taxied aircraft to [Runway] 8. Aircraft Y was orbited at 105 5NNW of the field. Aircraft Z; a C172; was inbound from the southwest for [Runway] 8. I saw Aircraft X approaching E1 and squared off Aircraft Z to give me proper wake turbulence. I reached out of Aircraft X and told him Runway 8 LUAW (Line Up And Wait). I did this twice and no response. When I turned to Ground to have him try Aircraft X; he was talking to the aircraft and told him that he was good right there on E1. I intended to reach out and cancel the LUAW and just let the C172 land. At that moment; I observed Aircraft X continue on E1 and cross the hold lines for 8. I reached out that time and said RWY8 cleared for takeoff via the SID. I was concerned about the wake turbulence. He started the takeoff roll. About a mile off the departure end I remembered Aircraft Y was out there and turned Aircraft X to a 310 and stopped his climb at 90. He was at 89 in an 87 MVA and turning away from higher terrain and MVAs. He did slop into an 110 MVA. Aircraft X took a moment to stop the climb and went to 96 before he said he was going back down to 90. I said Roger.I understand that I cannot turn someone below an MVA outside of the DVA; but Aircraft X was above the MVA when the turn was issued and the turn lead him to a lower MVA that 90 cleared. I understand performance of aircraft and pulling a last minute change on an aircraft will cause them to slop turns. In this case that's what happened. The turn was a sloppy turn.I don't hold the hold bar crossing against the aircraft because he could have heard me and have been cross channeled. I don't hold the altitude above the clearance against him because I did issue the instruction late.I pulled the aircraft off the SID because I felt like I was going to hit Aircraft Y with him. I felt like the safest decision was to turn Aircraft X away from the traffic. I could have allowed him to continue the climb to 100 because Aircraft Y was at 105. Once I saw him established in the turn I could have tried to apreq higher for him. My decisions were made within seconds and I didn't feel like I had time to call radar and to coordinate anything different. I was simply trying to not hit Aircraft Y. Hindsight is 20/20 and looking at it now I feel like I could have safely let the aircraft continue to climb; but I was not talking to Aircraft Y and with the wake turbulence it was a risk I was not willing to take with seconds to fix it.I feel a little discouraged to be told by Management that I should not have vectored an aircraft out of a situation that I thought would be been a pretty dangerous NMAC. I did not feel like Aircraft X altitude in the turn was an issue with the terrain. I watched him out the windows in the turn and felt that the turn would continue to lead him to the lower MVA that 90 cleared. The mountains are closer to the field on the south side; so a south turn would not have helped.The aircraft has not been amended to RV at 9. It slipped through data. It slipped through Ground; and in the moment of trying to not give Aircraft Z wake turbulence; it slipped through me.
Ambiguous,On approach to IAH on Runway 26L south out NEWLY; heading to intercept final a momentary RA flag appeared at 5;300 [ft.] for about 5 seconds on the FO (First Officer) side. Captain side showed no failure. Rest of flight uneventful no disruptions or errors
Ambiguous,On approach to 26L into IAH I had an RA flag for about 5 seconds at 8;300 ft. just outside ZAPPO intersection it was only the First Officer side I reported it to ATC and no other failures or issues were noticed on the approach after. This was the second time this happened to me on this same approach; it was a different aircraft as well.
Aircraft,At cruise flight FL330; a pop sound was heard followed by a Master Caution 'Electric' and Master Caution 'Air Condition' indication. Upon inspection of the overhead panel; the 'Standby Power Off' light; both 'Pack Lights'; and all three 'Zone Temp' lights were illuminated. QRH procedures were completed but all the lights remained illuminated. Then an observation of zero indication was noticed on the brake pressure gauge and PA comms/intercoms with the flight attendants were lost. Communications and intentions were (and had to be) completed in person with the Purser and to all the passengers. [Priority handling was requested] by the Captain and out of precaution (Concern of pressurization loss) a descent to FL250 was initiated. After communication/coordination between the flight deck crew; Dispatch and Company Maintenance; it was established that circuit breaker 'Bat Bus Sect 2' behind the First Officer seat had popped. With further discussion between Dispatch and Maintenance; a diversion to ZZZ was decided as best course of action. At about 20NM North of the ZZZZZ fix the diversion to ZZZ was initiated. Landed in ZZZ uneventfully.
Company Policy,On Date we had a bag come down to the bag room with out a tag; When the tag came down it had hand written fire arms on it. I received the bag about ten minutes [prior] to departure. I tried to call Management to figure out if its safe to load. We did not have one on duty. This put me in a position of guessing if it was safe to load.
Ambiguous,The flight to DCA was uneventful till about 5 miles on final. We had a constant tail wind on the approach around 30-40 kts. Approach was conducted on autopilot. We broke off around 1400-1800 ft. and continued in marginal VMC. After we passed 1000 ft. in stable conditions I noticed that aircraft slowly and then more aggressively starting to pitch down and vertical speed suddenly increasing from 800-900 ft/min to 1200-1800 ft/min. I was hoping that autopilot would correct this pitch down moment; but it didn't respond as I expected. I disconnected autopilot and stabilized path and speed before 500 ft. AGL. The rest of the of the approach and landing was uneventful. I would think that there was a combination of factors of the strong tailwind and some interference from the ground facilities. I am not sure if 5G interference played a role in this approach. I hope my case was a single event today; but if there were numerous aircraft affected on the approach this day; it should be investigated.
Ambiguous,In the flare just prior to touchdown on Runway 36L at MEM got a [tailstrike warning] activation--'deedoo deedoo; go around! tailstrike!' Honored the activation and initiated a go around. Everything was looking good for the landing; no idea what triggered the activation. Normal go around; pattern; and subsequent landing. No idea what caused the activation. Landing was looking good. No suggestions other than possible re-calibration of the [tail strike warning system] for that airplane.
Aircraft,The weather was not a problem as we were planning to leave ZZZ. There were normal flows and timing on the ramp and we taxied out to RWY XXR with no problems.We took off and switched to Departure. Captain and I noticed an amber indication on the OIL TEMP on the left engine. We talked about it briefly but were given further ATC instructions to climb to FL200 and switch to another frequency. We noticed the OIL QTY read 0 on the left engine stack but was still white like normal. We reached FL200 and asked to stay at FL200 to run a checklist. We pulled out the QRH and ran 'Engine Oil Temperature (PW)'. We ran through the checklist and retarded the throttle and started a clock. Captain talked about where we should go and I mentioned returning back to [departure airport] since we left there. Captain mentioned we should ask [Company] but at that time we were watching the OIL TEMP and he was continuing to retard the throttle and the Oil Temp continued to rise.  The Oil Temp went from amber to red and smoke began filling the cockpit. I immediately donned my mask and watched Captain put his on. During this time; he shut down the engine as I was kind of in shock. After a few moments; the shock wore off and I think at this time asked [for] direct to ZZZ with a descent. We were given direct and a descent to; I think; 5000 ft. ATC became distracting at this point asking for our problem and I think I told them standby. They asked again and I was somewhat terse saying we had smoke in cockpit and shutdown an engine with two souls on board and fuel for at least 4 hours.  After that Captain asked me to confirm the engine was shut down and I pulled out the QRC for 'ENGINE FIRE or Engine Severe Damage or Separation' (We did not have fire lights; but I think the smoke led us to do this over engine shutdown in flight (it happened very fast)). I ran through the steps and confirmed what he had done and then pulled the Engine Fire switch (which is way harder to push the button and pull the switch out in the airplane than the sim). He told me to put in the approach and 'nuke' the box. I was somewhat struggling mentally and fumbled my way through it and Captain was having to be quite directive. I asked if he wanted the QRH for 'ENGINE FIRE or Engine Severe Damage or Separation' and began to go through the checklist over interphone. Captain continued to fly and we ran through the checklist (looking back through checklist I read through all the steps; but I don't think I verbalized everything). Halfway through the checklist is when the fog and the startle of the event began to pass for myself and mentally got back into the game. We stayed in that checklist and I talked with ATC and ran through everything. Time finally felt like it was slowing down when we were getting vectors to final. We got on final and ran through the deferred items and Captain made a really nice 20 flap landing with gusty winds. We taxied off and let fire and rescue look over the left engine. They told us they saw nothing so Captain made the call that it would be safe to taxi back to ramp and much quicker than waiting on a tug. We taxied back with no problems and shut down normally. I noticed that the clock that had been running was at either 37 or 39 minutes since we started timing the engine oil temperature. Everyone met us at the jet and we opened the windows and then got out of the plane.The cause of the event was the oil departed the left engine. Oil found on underside of wing and engine blades. Further investigation of the engine would give insight into what went wrong and how it possibly could be prevented.
Weather,Weather at PDX was at minimums for ILS CATI with autoland not available due to 5G Tower location. Visibility 1/4SM with Tower also reporting visibility at 1/2 mile on ATIS. Approach Control reported 10R RVR below requirement and 10L 6000+ RVR. We elected to proceed with ILS 10L. Nothing seen at minimums; missed approach and received radar vector to wait for weather to improve. 10R reported above RVR requirements; proceeded with ILS 10R. After FAF; Tower reported RVR slightly below requirements. We proceeded with the approach as we were beyond the FAF. Approach lighting system visible at missed approach point; runway visible slightly before 100 ft. AGL. Fix the 5G issues! This is adding a lot of additional workload and safety hazards to flights that should be easy utilizing a proven safe autoland system.Also; the PDX ATIS I was unclear as to what the visibility was - 1/4 or 1/2 mile. Would have preferred latest RVR.
Aircraft,While being vector to final and at 1;500 feet the F4 (Flight Attendant 4) called the cockpit. The First Officer was pilot flying so I answered the call.  The F4 informed me that they were experiencing a fumes event and that the F3 had passed out while exiting the lavatory. (The First Officer and myself were not experiencing any smells or odors). I informed the F4 that we were only about 7 miles from the airport and that we would be on the ground in less than five minutes. I asked the F4 if we needed medical personnel to meet us he said not at that time and that the F3 was conscious.  We were next to land I did not declare an emergency and we did not contact med link.  After landing and taxing clear of the runway and after completing the after landing checklist I asked the First Officer to call the back and get an update on the F3 and see if we need medical personnel to meet us. The First Officer called back to the inflight and spoke with the F4 who was standing next to the F3 and we both could hear the F3 saying she didn't require or want any medical assistance on arrival. Upon gate arrival we deplaned the 40 customers and no one mentioned smelling anything. After all the customers were off the plane I took the Cabin Odor Report Form to the cabin and discussed the event with the inflight crew. They informed me at that time that they started smelling something shortly after we were descending below 10;000ft. The smell was most noticeable from the emergency exits aft. The F3 had been in the aft lavatory and upon exiting she said she took three deep breaths and then the other flight attendants say she passed out; however the F3 said she only felt light headed but never passed out.  During this discussion I was informed that the inflight crew had asked a Deadheading flight attendant to occupy the F3's jumpseat position during landing. After completing the Cabin Odor form I contacted our Dispatcher and Maintenance Control and the duty Chief Pilot. The flight attendants contacted Med Aire and Med Aire advised 3 of the 4 flight attendants to go to the emergency room to get checked out before they would release them to fly again.
Aircraft,Previous flight was an overnight.  Dark aircraft upon arrival; started APU and used APU bleed and packs at gate. Shortly after takeoff; both the FO (First Officer) and I began smelling a 'dirty sock' odor coming from the vents in the cockpit.  This began faintly and became stronger for a few minutes.   I went on oxygen intermittently and the odor was mostly gone by the time we were climbing through 10;000 MSL.   I asked the inflight crew if they had detected anything in the cabin and they had not.  We notified Dispatch and Maintenance Control and were requested to continue to ZZZ1.  Strong 'dirty sock' odor returned in descent at approximately FL 230.  Persisted for approximately 10 minutes.   PACK 1 was turned off which seemed to help some.  However; odor came back strong again a few minutes later even with PACK 1 off.  The FO and I again used oxygen intermittently.   Odor mostly dissipated prior to landing. Airbus Cabin Odor Reporting Form completed.  The aircraft has a history of APU auto-shutdowns:  no less than five in the last few weeks.
Ambiguous,After lift off on Runway 35 at ILM ; we started getting unreliable RA readings. As we approached the departure end of the Runway; 'CAUTION terrain' GPWS popped up. I pitched for 20 degrees and verified we were maintaining a positive a rate of climb. We had a light Aircraft weight that day and took off half way down the Runway so I was confident we were above any obstacles. Once we were through about 500 ft. the RA altimeter was working appropriately. As a precaution I notified ATC of 'possible' 5g interference. Dispatch was notified as well. Upon evaluating the remainder of the flight there were no issues with the approach and landing phase. I did not feel a need for a write up on the RA alt. I was aware there were no 5g NOTAMS in ILM but never had issues with the RA before that produced a GPWS caution alert before so I covered all the bases for safety.
Ambiguous,While on an ILS 4R into EWR; I was the Captain; pilot flying. The EWR weather was 800 broken with light rain. Right at the cloud base; I lost my flight director; ILS raw data (including standy att); and VNAV PDI info. First Officer instrumentation remained normal. I maintained attitude and broke out in a few seconds low and right of course. (We received a low altitude warning from ATC). We had a normal landing. I wrote up all unusual indications and did a follow up call to Maintenance Control the following day.
Ambiguous,Cat3 Autoland thoroughly briefed and flown based on ATIS 1/4 mi and VV (Vertical Visibility) 200 ft. On approach; prior to feathered notch; ATC reported RVR as 3000 ft. TD (Touchdown) and 2400 ft. RO (Rollout) with significant tailwind until ~ 200 ft. and changing to small headwind below that altitude. Also; ATC advised that previous aircraft reported breaking out/ at 100-200 ft. Since weather was marginal; I elected to continue with the autoland approach. We extended landing gear and flaps earlier than normal; but tailwind still made it difficult to slow the aircraft. Aircraft was approximately 20 knots fast at 1000 ft. and acknowledged and correcting at that stability gate and callout. We were stable at +12-15 kts. at the 500 ft. gate; and with Cat 3 Dual displayed; the callout was made. LAND was annunciated by 350 ft. and FO (First Officer) called 'Approaching Minimums' at 200 ft. RA (Radio Altimeter). At this point; I could begin to see Runway 04R lighting and portions of runway thru bottoms of ceiling. FO called 'Minimums' at 100 ft. RA and after verifying Cat 3 Dual displayed; I responded with 'Landing'. Then things got interesting. Nearly simultaneous with my 'Landing' call; I noticed the red autoland light illuminated for no obvious reason. The autopilots were still engaged and there were no master cautions or warnings. The aircraft was clearly aligned with Runway 04R touchdown zone and we were below the ceiling and; as advertised; had 3000 ft. RVR. I opted to disconnect the autopilot and auto thrust between 80-100 ft. and continued to land with more than adequate visual reference as the safest option. I did not notify the Tower Controller of failed autoland for two reasons. First; the Tower was busy coordinating a go-around with a following flight and then we needed to concentrate on and clarify taxi instructions as Boston controllers were using Runway 4L/22R as an active taxiway. Secondly; at the time of the event; I did not suspect 5G interference so it was not reported to Tower or Dispatch; but we did document failed autoland in a maintenance write up. Post flight review of the red autoland illumination causes; and a process of elimination during later crew debrief; lead me to suspect 5G interference caused a 15 ft. (or more) discrepancy between radar altimeters resulting in the malfunction. The autopilots did not disengage nor did we notice any LOC/GS scales or flight director bars flashing for excessive deviation or signal loss.
Aircraft,"During the preflight walk around; I observed a small; approximately 5-inch piece of what appeared to be a piece [of] Teflon seal protruding from the bottom of the #1 engine at the nacelle seam. This discrepancy was reported to Maintenance and signed off before pushback. The takeoff; climb; and initial phase of cruise were all routine with the exception of slightly more turbulence than normal - nothing more than continuous light and occasional moderate; resulting in the seat belt sign being illuminated slightly longer and the FAs (Flight Attendant) being seated a bit more than normal. West of [the] river; the ride had smoothed out considerably; [so the] seat belt sign [was] off; and flight conditions became VMC.At FL360 approximately 200 NM east of ZZZ; we observed a G RSVR LO LVL ECAM. After running the complete ECAM; the CA (Captain); pilot monitoring; broke out the QRH and reviewed the entire procedure; including all of the INOP systems; most notably: GREEN HYD; SPLR 1+5; N/W STRG; NORM BRK; L/G RETRACT and REVERSER 1. We discussed the ramifications of continuing to ZZZ1 and after consulting Maintenance Control and Dispatch; decided that [requesting priority handling] with ATC and diverting to ZZZ would be the best and safest course of action. Our assumption was that there was a leak in the green hydraulic system as the HYD page indicated almost no fluid remaining in the green system. We were below max landing weight; so we accepted vectors onto the ZZZZZ Arrival and subsequently requested Runway XXL based upon the runway length. We calculated our landing distance to be approximately 6;000 ft. and Dispatch backed us up by calculating a stopping distance of 6;790 ft. Once coordination with Dispatch and Maintenance Control were completed; we ensured all applicable checklists were completed and briefed ATC; the FAs; and the passengers. We elected for the CA to take over as the pilot flying; and I assumed the duties of pilot monitoring during the arrival. We also elected to start the APU.When we were both comfortable with the state of the aircraft; our plan; and the field conditions; we began slowing the aircraft; configuring; and emergency-extended the landing gear at approximately 20 NM on final to Runway XXL. After executing the L/G Gravity Extension Checklist; we received indications that the gear was down and locked with the gear doors open; as expected. Shortly after extending the landing gear; we noticed blue procedural steps on the STS (Status) page for the approach to turn on both the green hydraulic pump and PTU; both of which we had secured in accordance with the original ECAM. After a brief discussion; we elected to turn both items on. However; within approximately one minute; we again saw the G RSVR LO LVL ECAM and promptly secured the green hydraulic pump and PTU in accordance with the ECAM at approximately 10 miles on final with the gear extended. Prior to touchdown; I made the PA call to brace; brace; brace"" followed by a ""remain seated; remain seated"" call as we approached a safe taxi speed on the runway after touchdown. The landing was uneventful and we ended up stopping on centerline using emergency brakes around the 7 board; 9;000 lb. remaining. After the crash crew inspected the aircraft and reported fluid under the #1 engine; Company Maintenance evaluated the aircraft; pinned the landing gear; and initiated a tow to the gate. We executed the Tow-In Procedure and multiple PA announcements were made to keep the passengers in the loop with what was going on prior to and during the tow."""
Aircraft,The report is to document an inflight incident involving the aircraft pressurization system which subsequently lead to return to field. The problem initiated during the climb phase of flight on the ZZZZZ departure. We were climbing through 16;000 feet to the assigned altitude flight level 230. I began hearing a high pitch noise which started out as faint. ZZZ ATC center controller cleared us to climb to FL340 and direct to way point ZZZ1. As we continued to climb; the high pitched noise became noticeably louder. The First Officer and I began to discuss and investigate to see if the source of the noise was in the communication system or elsewhere. I briefly removed my headset and noticed that the noise much louder. We deduced that the problem was not in the communication system but somewhere  else we could not identify. We began to use our SOPs and  tactics to troubleshoot the problem. We considered the possibility of a leak affecting pressurization. I commanded the first officer continued to fly the aircraft and request from ATC to level off at FL260 to address an issue. At FL260;  we slowed to 250 knots. I opened the QRH to Loss of Pressurization section. Running the checklist; we compared the pressurization indications on the EICAS against the table in the checklist.  The table stated the following information: 26;000 ft / CAB ALT 4100 / @P 7.4.  The press. EICAS indications were higher than the table posted: CAB ALT 6900 / @P 6.1 / CAB RATE 0 fpm. The high pitch noise was significantly louder at FL260 than at the lower altitudes. We checked the pressurization controller which was properly set. We also checked our respective DV (Direct Vision) and forward windshield's for leaks. DV windscreen were properly secure and nothing was noticeable. We contacted the flight attendant to query if there was any unusual high pitched noise in the cabin area. Considering this noise condition and the difference in the pressurization reading; we contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control via company frequency to aid our troubleshooting. We completed all tasks instructed by Maintenance Control and checked with the Flight Attendant for any leaks at the main cabin and galley service door with no defining discoveries in those areas. At the end of communication with Maintenance Control; the decisions was made to return to ZZZ airport.  We were transferred back to the dispatcher to get an amendment for return to field (RTF). At that moment;  I received an intercom call from the field attendant informing us of a loud hissing noise in the lavatory coming from behind the mirror (potable water tank location) above the sink.  We contacted ATC to advise them our pressurization problem and requested vectors to return to ZZZ and began our descent to 10;000 feet. We received our vector clearance direct to ZZZ and descent to 16;000 feet. The first officer and I assessed that the aircraft status was adequate with stable pressurization reading not requiring the need for [requesting priority handling] and immediate descent. The First Officer continued to fly giving me greater latitude to manage the situation. I contacted the Flight Attendant to complete a briefing for our RTF to ZZZ and He read back the instructions. I briefed the passengers the nature of our abnormal situation and intentions to return to ZZZ. We received the amendment for RTF from dispatch via ACARS. We reprogrammed the  FMS; setup navigation instruments; conducting Weight & Balance performance calculations; and completed checklist/ briefings for our landing. ATC cleared us continued descent to 10;000 feet. The Flight Attendant call back to inform us the passengers were briefed and cabin was ready for landing. I was able to contact ZZZ station operations to inform them we were returning to the airport. After a thorough briefing and giving due consideration to the current situation; we agreed to transfer control of the aircraft and I would complete the landing. We vectored around some reported convective cells continued flight to without further incident. We observed at approximately 1;000 feet prior to landing; the cabin made a loud squealing noise during depressurization.  We landed on Runway XXL and taxing to gate XX.  Upon arrival at the gate; we shutdown the aircraft and completed all required checklist. After the deplaning of the passengers; I initiated a maintenance write up. During the post-flight inspection; the potable water service cap was discovered uninstalled. The flight was met by the Base Chief Pilot; Company Gate Agent; and Maintenance Technicians. We were able to transfer to another aircraft and continue the flight without further incident.
Aircraft,[I] noticed [a] strange odor on takeoff roll. Flight Attendants called passing about 7000 ft. Determined odor not dissipating; so [flight] returned to ZZZ.Cause - poor aircraft design.Suggestion - fix problem with contaminated air entering cabin/cockpit.
Aircraft,After takeoff from ZZZ; the FA's (Flight Attendant) reported a chemical/exhaust smell and a brief period of a haze in the cabin. Both of the items soon disappeared; but we were able to briefly smell a exhaust type smell briefly in the cockpit as well. As we started the descent into ZZZ1 and the power levers retarded to idle thrust; the odor returned and was reported by the rear FA's but without a haze report this time. The odor was faintly noticeable in the cockpit and would dissipate quickly once the power levels were returned to a greater than idle power setting. After landing and upon gate arrival; I consulted with the FA's and decided the aircraft was to be written up for a smoke/odor/fume event. The FA's met with their respective Flight Service managers and were evaluated by EMT's at the airport. The EMT's instructed the FA's to seek further medical attention. At that point; the FA's left the airport for the hospital to be further evaluated. The FO (First Officer) and I decided that we did not need medical attention. Our aircraft was taken out of service and eventually cancelled due to lack of cabin crew.The aircraft had been sitting in ZZZ for 24 hours with constant rain. My guess is certain areas that get hot following application of bleed air may have steamed off latent oil and/or other fluids that may have been ingested into the packs.[I suggest] more aircraft maintenance that revolves around preventative care of the aircraft.
Ambiguous,Upon departure on 4L in JFK; we were in a turn at 1.5 DME off the JFK VOR to 100. We were established on the 100 heading for less than one minute and were given direct WAVEY. We were climbing at 250 kt. at approximately 2500 ft. per minute and turning direct WAVEY. We received a 'wup wup pull up terrain terrain' passing through 3200 ft. We only received this aural warning one time. Our MSA was 2000 ft. in that quadrant. Since we were climbing and the warning went away; no evasive action was taken. The MFD remained normal with no terrain overlay for escape guidance. After the event we believed it was a possible 5G event.
Weather,"Entering the ramp after arrival; I attempted to make a right turn to park where the Marshaller was indicating. I would estimate speed about 5 kt.; maybe a little more. However; the airplane did not turn when the tiller was turned. So; I immediately stepped on the brakes to stop; but we continued to slide straight ahead! As a last-ditch effort; the other pilot suggested I pulled thrust reverse; but it didn't seem to have much effect. However; the airplane finally stopped 15 - 20 ft. short of some equipment and some freighter cans. Since this position was too close to turn out again; we shut down to conserve fuel for the return flight. ZZZ Operations tried to bring the stairs over; but a snow pile prevented it from position at Door 1L; so stairs were positioned to Door 1R and the passengers deplaned. As soon as we had the local phone; Dispatch and the Duty Officer was consulted.When I was able; I did walk"" around the airplane; but it was very obvious why the airplane slid. There was water over ice; and it was so slippery it was hard to stand up. Also; the wind was blowing - wind 080 at about 20 plus gusts; so we had a tailwind plus 2 engines at idle thrust as we entered the ramp. The runway itself seemed good; but braking on the ramp was nearly nil.After surveying the situation and consultation with the Duty Officer [and] Station Operations; Operations moved the equipment in front of the airplane to provide room to turn; and the ramp was sanded. With about 5 or 6 wing walkers; we started the left engine and were able to spin out of the tight spot. We shut down; put the stairs up to Door 1L and boarded the passengers for the return flight. No damage to any equipment nor injury to any person. The station personnel were super helpful and moved every object that I asked them to move. Also; I was fortunate to have a very sharp Captain and Check Airman in the right seat. We discussed everything before deciding what to do. I wish the sand truck had sanded the icy ramp before we arrived! Proceed very sloooowly on icy ramps."""
Ambiguous,4 mile final approach and cleared to land Runway 28R in full landing configuration; message displayed a LG AIR/GND FAIL message. QRH indicated possible loss or degradation of multiple systems including braking; nose steering; and thrust rev. We were in a safe position and altitude to request an immediate right base for Runway 30. We executed a left turn for the right base while still in landing configuration-gear down flaps 45. ATC cleared us to land 30. Upon landing; all systems functioned normally and the message extinguished.Not my area of expertise but presumably a faulty air/ground sensor(s).Improved maintenance procedures could help prevent such events. Maintenance department should trouble shoot malfunctions beyond; 'could not duplicate.'
Aircraft,Boarded the aircraft and sat because the flight was delayed. FA2 (Flight Attendant 2) came from the back of the aircraft asking if it smelled weird to us. I walked to the back and before I lowered my mask I could already smell a musty dirty sock smell; it was very strong. There was a deadheading pilot onboard and we asked him to come smell it; he acknowledged the smell but wasn't worried about it which put us at ease. Once we were up in the air the smell remained and was strong back in the galley. FA2 called the pilots and they said they could also smell it in the flight deck and were already starting to write a report. The smell dissipated about 20 minutes later; as we started descending the smell came back and was really strong. My head was hurting and I felt dizzy. FA2 indicated similar and even strong reactions; FA3 indicated she had a bad headache and FA1 in the front said she felt dizzy and faint. We communicated our symptoms with the pilots and asked they call for people to meet the flight. After deplaning we connected with a [Flight Attendant Service personnel] and she helped us get connected to a hospital to get tested. We waited about an hour trying to get transportation to the hospital to get checked out; we arrived at the hospital and they said they've had crews there before. They took vitals and blood tested us to make sure we were okay. Our tests came back negative although our symptoms all remained. We then spent two hours after being discharged trying to get a hotel and transportation so we could rest.
Human Factors,Given an 'immediate takeoff' clearance for Runway 23 APF at XA:55z. 20-30 seconds into the takeoff roll we are instructed to cancel our takeoff clearance and then immediately abort. A few seconds later we observe a light transport jet landing on 14; cross in front of us at a very high speed.The controller was noticeably over-saturated with the sheer volume of air traffic and this happened during a runway change (from 14 to 23).
Procedure,This does not refer to our aircraft; but the departing aircraft we witnessed being deiced. We arrived in ZZZ and had to hold off the gate while the departing aircraft got deiced with a 'two-step' process. This was during the difficult weather conditions of the winter storm this past week. ZZZ apparently has one truck to deice. I can't be sure; but I think it may even have been driven by the Boom Operator rather than in the cab. So a one man/ one truck operator.As I watched him deice the aircraft I was concerned that he was not deicing correctly and would like guidance.  The way I have always understood the process to work was Type 1 the complete aircraft to deice and Type 4; then to provide the anti-ice for the specified holdover time. The whole Ramp operation appears to be contract rather than (Company) Personnel.The Iceman started at the nose and moved to the left wing with Type 1.  He then switched to Type 4 and applied that. He then moved to the tail and did the same. Type 1 followed by Type 4; he then moved to the right wing with Type 1 and Type 4. The process took quite a while even like that. My concern would be contamination of the Type 4 with Type 1 and subsequent reduction or nullification of the anti-ice ability of the Type 4 and any holdover time.If I am right and the process was incorrectly done; then it's a Safety issue that needs resolved and correct (Company) deicing procedures should be taught. If I am not; then I would like to know for my own edification.
Human Factors,Long flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1; dropped into a very busy approach sector. Weather was 1800 overcast; and the RNAV to [Runway] XXL was programmed in the box. The brief was to be below the weather at the FAF; and do the visual backed up by the RNAV. Tailwind from the west for descent. It was a very busy sector and the Controller overshot us to the east on final and gave us a 330 vector to get back to final. Once on final; the Tower had said we would break out at 600 ft; which I could see as a scattered deck. I reset the minimums before the FAF and started down. When I broke out of all the clouds; I could see I was low on [the] glidepath; and I leveled off to intercept the glidepath and landed. Tower gave us a check altitude call; as I was in the process of correcting.What I should have done; was to realize how task saturated that segment of the approach was; realize I was not properly set up for the RNAV approach and executed a go-around and get set up properly.   With all of the vectors and speed changes; it was unrealistic to fly the full RNAV approach. We were only going to get the final approach section.  I was using Level Change to manage the descent with the tailwind.  VNAV would have worked much better to adapt to changing conditions.
Ambiguous,The ATIS at SAT was advertising the visual approach to Runway 22.  Since the flight was planned using the MARCS 1 Arrival I loaded the RNAV (RNP) 22 Approach in the box since it had BRAUN (IAF) as a common fix with the STAR and briefed a visual approach backed up by the RNAV (RNP) 22.  Upon reaching the MARCS fix at 13;000 feet approach gave us a 180 degree heading and a descent to 7;000 feet.  I slowed the aircraft to get the flaps to 1 to help with the descent.  Approach subsequently gave us a 270 degree heading and a descent to 4;000 feet and then 3;000 feet and I selected flaps 2.  At this point we were inside of the BRAUN intersection and the current heading would bring us close to the ZALYO (IF) fix so we extended [the radial] off of the ZIGDA (FAP) fix. With the runway in sight approach cleared us for the visual to Runway 22.  While monitoring the plan view I saw that once inside of ZALYO I could descend to 2;100 feet and proceeded to do so. A few miles from ZIGDA I selected 1;700 feet and selected the approach mode.  I was trying to get to altitude so that the approach would capture (FINAL APP). As we were descending both the F/O and myself were looking at a surface mining operation and associated tower/crane and commented about how low it looked and almost at the same time we received an [GPWS] obstacle call.  I clicked off the auto pilot and climbed back to 2;100. We were still a couple miles from the ZIGDA fix and had Runway 22 in sight the entire time.  We finished configuring the aircraft and proceeded uneventfully to landing.  We were both surprised with the obstacle call as an obstacle is not readily evident on the [chart] plan view.  It's not until you look really close that short of the UWEZY fix there is an obstacle. However it is partially hidden by two arrows corresponding to two different approach courses.  This is an approach that can bite you pretty quick especially if given vectors and then cleared a visual; especially if backing it up with the RNAV (RNP) 22.  (If given vectors the RNAV (GPS) Y Runway 22 would be a better choice).  By extending [the radial] off of ZIGDA the only altitude associated is 1;700 feet which then puts the aircraft too close to the obstacle.  Another item is that the ZIGDA fix is only 2.8 miles from the runway so the expectation of 1;500 feet AGL [a standard glide path] and 5 miles from FAF to runway is not there.Add a note to the company pages highlighting that the ZIGDA fix is only 930 feet above and 2.8 miles from the runway.  Change how the obstacle short of the UWEZY fix is accounted for  - possible a note on the plan view.  For myself; I am going to put the Runway/field in the fix page and put a 5 mile ring and then ensure that I am at 1;500 feet AGL (3-to-1[ratio]).
Procedure,Encountered wake turbulence on short final into LAX; Runway 24R; north of the new stadium. This resulted in several EICAS messages. Crew discussed missed approach. Decided to continue to land; as the airplane was being hand flown in visual conditions. After landing; in-flight EICAS messages disappeared and new EICAS messages appeared (ADS Probes Fail). Error messages probably caused by disagreeing readings between the ADS probes caused by wake turbulence. Greater spacing on final into airports.
Airport,After a non-eventful landing at BED started our taxi. Made the turn from a snow covered taxiway onto a taxiway that had just been swept but not sanded; all 3 wheels lost traction simultaneously and we began to slide sideways to the edge of the taxiway. Only one main (right) and the nose-wheel barely entered the snow and the left main was still on the taxiway. Due to the existing conditions the rate of taxi was slower than normal which prevented the aircraft from sliding at a fast rate or traveling far resulting in zero damage to the aircraft. [Ground crew] was able to successfully tow the aircraft out and to the FBO where a Mechanic did a thorough inspection which verified no damage and the aircraft was returned to duty. I believe the sweeping of the taxiway revealed the underlying ice sheet; had it been sanded or not swept at all I believe the incident could have been avoided.
Aircraft,Taxied from the FBO to the runway at ZZZ. After being cleared for takeoff started the takeoff roll and began to feel the nose-wheel start to shake around 40 knots. The takeoff was aborted and we exited the runway. The nose-gear pin was most likely not secured completely allowing it to wiggle loose during taxi. There was minor damage to the nose-wheel(tire only) but it remained completely inflated. We re-secured the gear pin and taxied to FBO whereas our company maintenance arranged for the tire to be changed. Work was performed and signed off by maintenance.
Human Factors,I was working Local Control combined with Ground Control; Flight Data; and Clearance Delivery. There was no other traffic in ZZZ. Winds were around 5 knts. with some mild precipitation over the field. Approach ZZZ Sector coordinate an Opposite Direction arrival for Flight Number to RunwayXX. I approved this request and the Aircraft X attempted an instrument approach to RunwayXY. At 1/2 mile final the Pilot reported a go-around. I asked the Pilot if they would like to remain under my control and attempt a VFR approach to RunwayXX; the Pilot decided they wanted to do this but wanted vectors. I then coordinated with Approach for control of the Aircraft X to be transferred back to Approach. I instructed the Pilot to fly RH while climbing to 030. The Pilot was south of the Runway at 015 heading NE on a heading of 060 at this time. The Pilot asked to be able to maintain 015 while on the 060 heading in order to maintain VFR while they make their Approach back to Runway XX. I allowed the aircraft to maintain VFR at 1500 ft. and instructed them to contact Approach and inform them that they are at 1500 ft. in order to maintain VFR. The Minimum Vectoring Altitude in the area of flight was 2000 ft. The Pilot went out to Approach and was climbed to 2000 ft. The Pilot attempted to a visual approach to Runway XX at 020 but was unable to join the final for the Approach. Approach then coordinated another Opposite Direction Approach to Runway XY. The Pilot then landed on Runway XY.In order to prevent this from happening again I will not allow aircraft to inform another Controller of their reasoning for a certain action. This is not an acceptable form of coordination in which assumptions are made and lead to improper flight handling. I will also not allow an aircraft to maintain altitudes below any listed Minimum Vectoring Altitude while leaving the airfield. I should have called Approach back with the Pilots request upon which they would have told me; unable; and had the aircraft maintain an altitude at or above the Minimum Vectoring Altitude.
Aircraft,Approximately 10 to 20 seconds after take off; we noted an amber RA (Radio Altimeter) flag on the Captain's PFD.  All other systems and indications were normal; and the First Officer's radio altimeter continued to function normally. The RA flag lasted for approximately 15 seconds; and then all indications and functions returned to normal. We reported the anomaly to Houston; sent a maintenance report; and reported the event to dispatch. The rest of the flight was conducted normally; and without further incident.
Aircraft,As the Captain continued his approach; downwind to MSY airport; the First Officer's radar altimeter began to flash; and display random; incorrect altitudes. Furthermore; a constant sound of a warning horn sounded; each time the radar altimeter mentioned displayed an altitude below 1;000 ft. When the landing gear was selected down; the horn silenced; and the radar altimeter in question now matched the Captain's radar altimeter. We landed without incident. A maintenance entry was filed; and a thorough bite test was performed by same. No faults were found. Maintenance Control suggested that the irregular indications we received may have been caused by 5g interference.
Human Factors,Arrival flight came in with pit 3 soaked with water. Class 9 [Hazmat] marked package base was also wet. After offload; lead ramp service employee notified immediate supervisor of the issue and potential Hazardous Materials spill. Scheduled local departure time of XA:10 was pushed back to XA:40. After updated departure time the crew was asked to speak with immediate Supervisor to determine condition of Hazmat package. Area Manager arrived and stated it was just water and gave a direct order for us to clean it up. Another ramp service employee voiced his concern in which Area Manager stated 'Are you refusing to do your job' in an aggressive manner. At that point; I contacted a lead from another gate who reiterated the fact that we cannot clean the pit of an aircraft if there is a potential Dangerous Goods spill and suggested that I get a Shop Steward. After following that direction and getting a Shop Steward; he informed the supervisors that were still on the gate that we cannot clean that aircraft and that a team of trained employees with proper PPE have to do the task. We were only given paper towels and Clorox wipes; nor are we trained to handle that task. The direct order issued by Area Manager is in direct violation of Safety Policies.
Aircraft,During the flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ; we received Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) Terrain; Terrain; Pull Up; annunciator on the right downwind about to turn to base for the visual to Runway XXL at ZZZ right after ATC approved us for the visual. This flight was at night with clear sky and runway insight. We received the Terrain; Terrain; Pull Up alert approximately abeam midpoint between IF (Initial Fix) and FAF (Final Approach Fix) at above 2000 ft within about 3NM on the right downwind. The pilot flying (FO) immediately responded to the alert by clicking the Autopilot off and followed the appropriate recovery procedure. As soon as the pilot flying initiated the recovery procedure the alert was eliminated. Both pilot flying (FO) and pilot monitoring (CA) looked outside and we had no visual of any terrain. As a result of this alert; we were unstable for the approach and we made a decision to terminate the approach and get radar vectors for another attempt for the RNAV (GPS) Runway XXL. ATC; began to give us radar vectors to the right downwind with a descent to 3000 ft. At 3000 ft on the right downwind we received another brief Terrain; Terrain; Pull Up; annunciator. The pilot flying immediately initiated the recovery procedure and the alert was immediately eliminated. Pilot monitoring asked ATC if there is any known terrain at our current position and altitude or if anyone has reported [a] similar alert. ATC informed us there was no terrain and no reports. The pilot monitoring noticed IRS REVERTED white message on the PFD during the Terrain; Terrain; Pull Up; annunciator and repositioned the aircraft coordinates not certain if this would have caused the Terrain; Terrain; Pull Up alert. We continued the approach and landed safely with no further issues. ATC stated they will disseminate the information to identify if there is any known issue. Possibly address the IRS issue if it was related to the false alert. Also; it might be related to the 5G interference and need further look into.
Weather,Uneventful until arriving to Company ramp at PWM. Approaching Gate X; silhouette was clear with Marshaler wands up. We observed what appeared to be slush in the silhouette; as a result I taxied approximately 5 knots; slow; steady cautious. The gate has a down slope toward the parking position.  With approximately 30 feet to go; I began braking to further slow. As I applied the brakes; there appeared to be no change in acceleration; I continued to steadily increase brake pressure as it appeared the aircraft appeared to accelerate. With full brake pressure applied; within approximately 10 feet of the planned stopping position; and no indication the aircraft was stopping; I extended the Thrust Reverses; (TR's) Passing the expected stop position; I began applying reverse thrust; however; it was at this point; the aircraft began to decelerate to a stop. It turns out the Reverse thrust never went above reverse idle; before stopping. After stopping; the tug was connected to reposition the aircraft. Debriefing the Maintenance Personnel who was also the Marshaler; he observed the main gear began sliding side-ways during the approach to stop. No damaged was noted by aircrew or maintenance; nor were any flight manual limits exceeded; but all parties acknowledged it was a very close call. The Maintenance Personnel said he requested salt and sand support from the airfield prior to our arrival; but was denied. It seemed PWM was aware of the ice fouling the ramp; which was under the water and slush observed on the surface. Failure to notify aircrew of the hazard is a cause. However; had the airport authority properly treated the ramp and taxiway area; the hazard would have been abated entirely.If ice is known to foul the parking spot; send a note during the in-range ACARS message to expect a tow in. If that window of opportunity is missed; drive the tug out and give marshaling directions to set brakes and shutdown. Of course; having the parking area properly treated would have solved most of the problems.
Procedure,We completed the NIXX3 arrival with no issue and ended up on a left downwind for Runway 17R. I was planning the ILS 17R for backup guidance for a visual approach. ATC had us assigned at 210 knots; vectored us heading 330 for a short base; left us at a high altitude; and cleared us for the visual into 17R effectively 'slam dunking' us to the runway. We began self factoring ourselves to intercept final at the FAF. We were left at 210 knots and high so we lowered the gear and began using spoilers to slow down in order to configure flaps. I switched to green needles to intercept the localizer and armed approach mode. Because we were so close there was a delay for the course to come alive which in turn caused a delay in our intercept and for us to begin overshooting final. The Captain took controls and the autopilot was disengaged to correct for this and we received a bank warning during the correction as we touched 45 degrees. There was no traffic interference and the slight overshoot was promptly corrected back to centerline on final. Immediately after once back on centerline during the configuration process ATC issued a low altitude warning at a radar altimeter of 960 feet. We verified we were slightly low; the captain added power and we climbed to 1;300 feet. The Captain verified the transfer of controls back to me; and I leveled out to re-intercept a proper glide path while continuing to configure. All proper call outs were made; no aircraft limitations were exceeded; and by 1;000 ft we were stabilized and cleared to land. The remainder of the approach; landing; and taxi was uneventful.The three main causes were ATC could have set us up for a better approach; task saturation; and autopilot reliance/I should have just hand flown the approach from the beginning instead of trying to have the autopilot intercept final.The main thing that can be done to avoid this is when using autopilot use white needles to intercept final when we're so close to the runway; or just hand fly the approach and use outside visual ques.
Procedure,On the CHPPR arrival into ATL; we were close enough behind a 747 that we were able to identify the aircraft type by sight. In the vicinity of HIDRO on the arrival; the aircraft suddenly and abruptly rolled approximately 40 degrees to the left. The autopilot did not disconnect and adequately recovered to wings level so the pilot flying did not disconnect the autopilot but protected the yoke with his hand. I immediately contacted Atlanta Approach and told them we needed an offset. He seemed confused and reluctant; informing us that we were 8 miles in trail. I told him we were experiencing significant wake turbulence due to a 25 kt tailwind and needed a heading. At this point the aircraft rolled again; about 20 degrees to the left. He still told us all he could do was offer a lower altitude; which I refused as it would have had the potential to exacerbate the problem. I told him we needed a heading of either 130 or 180 and nothing else was acceptable; and that it was not a request. He assigned us a heading of 180. After the 747 had flown past our intended flight path we accepted a turn back towards the arrival and the remainder of the flight was uneventful. Wake turbulence from inadequate in trail spacing
Aircraft,Loss of brakes upon landing in ZZZ.After landing  in ZZZ; the aircraft displayed a ECAM 'Brakes Released'. We applied the brakes and reversers it became apparent that we had limited or no braking. The memory item for loss of braking was applied and at the anti skid/ nose wheel steering switch off; the aircraft reverted to the yellow hydraulics and we regained braking without nose wheel steering. We stopped on the runway with about 1/2 the runway remaining and decided it was best to clear the runway using differential brakes and stop clear of the active. We called ZZZ tower and let them know we would like the aircraft inspected for a flat tire and coordinated for a tow. A ZZZ Operations truck came quickly and inspected and said the tires were all fine.  The tug  then towed us to the gate. After inspection of the aircraft the #3 tire had a flat spot.
Aircraft,Flight encountered heavy fumes event below 10;000 feet all the way to parking aircraft and shutting down the engines. The smell was overwhelming and similar to dirty socks or mildew. There was a noticeable change in my thoughts from a relaxed and reactively mindset to a distracted; intense and concerned state.Due to our proximity to airport and the fact that we were being vectored to final approach; we did not reference any manuals. Landing the aircraft immediately was my focus. We did attempt to limit the infusion of fumes by turning off Pack 1. That did not make any noticeable difference. We then turned Pack One on and turned off Pack Two. That did not make any noticeable difference. We then turned on Pack Two. Prior to landing; I believe both pilots were responding at a different rate than normal. At one point I called for flaps or landing gear and did not received a response from the First Officer. When I looked over at him; his eyes were closed. I repeated the command and he opened his eyes and did the required task. Shortly afterward; Approach Control ordered a frequency change. The First Officer responded by moving his hand and pulling the transmit button and making the read back; however his hand was not on the side stick. I told him and he then repeated the callback normally. We landed shortly afterward. On the way to the gate; the First Officer seemed to be operating much slower and appeared slightly confused on during our short taxi to the gate.After arriving at the gate; there was a temporary fogginess to my thoughts. Everything I did had a slower and sloppier feel to it. I had to concentrate much more in order to accomplish routine things. The mechanic told me there were 'several' write ups in the logbook for fume events. I was not aware of this. The [Operations Control] Duty Chief told me that there were no write ups in the last 25 flight cycles. I've heard that over servicing of oil can create fumes events; so it might be important to note that a weekly inspection was accomplished prior to our flight.After leaving the aircraft; I ate some food and drank a lot of water. The fogginess seemed to lift after a period of time. The First Officer also ate some food and appeared to recover his normal level of alertness.
Aircraft,While taxiing to gate in ZZZ after landing the flight attendants informed us that they experienced a fume event shortly after passing 10;000 ft. on descent. All four flight attendants experienced fume exposure symptoms ranging from burning throat; dizziness or nausea. I asked if anyone needed medical assistance and they all said they did not.
Procedure,The aircraft we picked up was slightly behind schedule inbound from ZZZ. We met with the previous flight crew and during the exchange covered an existing MEL for the AUTO function of the Power Transfer Unit (PTU) and a new write-up for the In-flight Entertainment System. The existing MEL for the PTU has an Operational Procedure (O) for the flight crew to follow. We reviewed MEL 29-11-XX; which simply has the crew manually turn the PTU ON or OFF depending on the phase of flight. I'd like to point out that step (1) of this Operational Procedure has the crew turn ON the PTU and ensure a particular message is displayed on the EICAS.The previous crew had already contacted Operations for the new write-up of the Entertainment System. A technician arrived to diagnose the new write-up. He first asked us to completely power down the aircraft and restart everything to see if this would clear the issue. The complete restart failed to fix the problem. The technician decided to deactivate the system by following the procedure laid out in the Nonessential Equipment and Furnishings (NEF) Guide. While he was doing this; we continued with our normal duties to get the flight out on time. [The NEF Guide] has a Maintenance Procedure (M) that requires several electronic circuit breakers to be OUT and LOCKED and two thermal circuit breakers to be OUT and COLLARED.The LTV technician appeared to be unfamiliar with the aircraft and the location of certain circuit breakers that needed to be locked. He was also not equipped with his own iPad resulting in the crew being more involved in the deferral than normal. The CA contacted operations and asked if Tech Ops could come out to assist the technician twice during the deferral. The second time our tech ops came out and the Captain asked about an EICAS message and whether or not it was related to the PTU. The technician confirmed it was. We assisted the technician with the location of the electronic circuit breakers on the synoptic page; however; we were unable to assist with locating the thermal circuit breakers. The technician eventually found all the circuit breakers and locked them as part of the procedure. The write-up was logged; signed off and the aircraft was released for flight.[The NEF Guide] does NOT have an Operational Procedure for the flight crew like the MEL for the PTU. There is no requirement for the crew to verify that the listed breakers are LOCKED or to cross-reference the EICAS display with the NEF. However; since we were assisting the technician with the location of the electronic circuit breakers; we did verify what was listed in the NEF was shown as LOCKED on the CB synoptic page.After take-off during initial climb out at approximately 1;000 feet; a CAUTION warning HYD 2B INOP displayed on the EICAS. The displayed message was extinguished once the flaps were completely retracted. Passing 10;000 feet; we discussed the message and thought it may have had something to do with the PTU MEL. We decided to review the NON-NORMAL ECL for HYD 2B INOP. This ECL has the crew manually turn ON the HYD 2B pump and see if the caution message remains displayed. We did this and the caution message reappeared. The ECL then directs the crew to turn OFF HYD 2B.We then reviewed the Hydraulic synoptic page and noticed that the PTU is tied to that system. With the loss of redundancy for that system coupled with the MEL for the PTU; the CA opted to contact dispatch and maintenance. They conferred and Operations requested we do an air return to ZZZ.After landing in ZZZ; MX arrived at the aircraft and started diagnosing the problem. It was discovered that circuit breaker ACMP 2B was OUT and LOCKED and this was the reason for the CAUTION message we experienced during takeoff. Needless to say; we were dumbfounded as to how the wrong circuit breaker was locked.We did an aircraft swap and were on our way to our destination. En route we were reviewing the events as they transpired to try and figure out how this had happened. We reviewed [the NEF guide] and noticed a hyperlink called 'ECB (Electronic Circuit Breaker) Locking Procedures'. Following this hyperlink brings you to a new page within the NEF that outlines the procedure on how to LOCK an electronic circuit breaker. The second page of this procedure shows circuit breaker ACMP 2B being locked. It became apparent to us that the LTV technician followed this procedure exactly as shown believing that this was part of the procedure. Due to the large number of circuit breakers that were LOCKED; ACMP 2B was lost in the list.
Aircraft,Preflight and departure were normal. In cruise at FL370; we received the 'COM Single PTT(Press To Talk) Stuck' ECAM. This was accompanied by 'HF 1 Transmitting' and 'VHF 1 Transmitting' in orange. We completed and cleared the 'COM Single PTT Stuck' ECAM a few times; but it would return again within a minute; so we eventually left it displayed. The 'HF 1 Transmitting' and 'VHF 1 Transmitting' messages came and went randomly for most of the rest of the flight. FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying) this leg and he remained so through the eventual landing.Additional indications:Unable to transmit or receive via any means. VHF; HF; SATCOM; INT; and CABIN on all ACPs (Audio Control Panels) were all completely inoperative. (No radio transmissions received on any radio for the rest of the flight.)The SATCOM screen on the MCDU (Multi-Function Control and Display Unit) flickered; and it switched rapidly back and forth between 'ready' and 'dialing.'There was loud pulsing static in both cockpit speakers; and in the overhead speakers throughout the cabin. (Learned this later in event from flight attendants.)We put on our headsets; but same loud pulsing static was present. Unable to communicate via Interphone (INT). Headphones not used for the rest of the flight.Random orange 'call' light and buzzer from the cabin every 30 seconds for first few minutes of the event; then it stopped. Later determined to be spurious - cabin was not calling during that time.We tried to call the cabin but the 'CABIN' ACP function was inoperative. EMER Cabin Call tried but also inoperative.We sent an initial ACARS message to Dispatch that we had lost all comms. We set the squawk to 7600.We ensured all green TX buttons were deselected on all three ACPs. We used the overhead ACP switching panel to see if we could gain comms via ACP 3 on either the Captain or FO side of the airplane. No change to the above list of indications. In fact; when we tried to engage any green TX button on any ACP; it would extinguish by itself after 2-3 seconds. If any ACP listening button was raised (white) we heard either the pulsing static or nothing. Observer hand mic and headset tried - no change. These were then unplugged. Both RMPs (Radio Management Panels) were switched off for a minute; and then back on. No changes.At this point we were out of ideas and outside the QRH; so I made a WiFi call on my personal phone to Dispatch. My airborne WiFi phone call was made via a wireless ear bud in my left ear only; so I could hear the FO with my right ear and keep both hands free to fully attend to my duties as PM (Pilot Monitoring).I explained our situation via phone call to Dispatch and they immediately conferenced in Maintenance. We spent at least 15-20 minutes on the phone with Maintenance trying to find any reset or other action that would restore comms. The only viable airborne reset found was for FWC (Flight Warning Computer) 1 and FWC 2. Maintenance directed us to try those resets; but there was no change; except to also knock ACARS offline for the rest of the flight. ATC was conferenced into the phone call; and they provided holding instructions over ZZZ at FL370.We were only able to communicate with the flight attendants by passing notes on paper back and forth under the cockpit door. We wrote to them to knock if they had an urgent need. I tried the cockpit PA handset and miraculously it did work. PA's were able to 'break through' the static on the cabin speakers; so I was able to make PA's to the cabin to keep the flight attendants and customers informed of the situation.In coordination with Dispatch and Operations Control; the decision was made to divert to ZZZ1. Dispatch requested priority handling for the flight and we concurred. Dispatch conferenced ATC in on my phone call again; and clearance to ZZZ1 was provided via the phone call. As we began the divert towards ZZZ1; the F1 knocked on the door. I looked through the peep hole and saw two flightattendants but no cart. We had only 42 passengers on board and I saw all were seated. Based on our agreement that a knock meant an urgent need; and the fact we had begun the divert and time was limited; I exercised my Captain's authority and opened the cockpit door to let the F1 into the cockpit. She communicated that the customers had 'seen our flight turn red on FlightAware/FlightRadar24' and were growing concerned. I was able to show her what we were dealing with in the cockpit. I also told her we had just turned towards ZZZ1 and would land in approximately 25 minutes. She understood the situation and the plan; and she returned to the cabin.Via PA; I advised the Customers of the divert to ZZZ1 and that we expected a normal landing and taxi to the gate. Further clearance for the approach and landing were passed to us from ATC via the WiFi phone call. At top of descent I asked for a follow-me truck to guide us on the ground to the gate. Landing and taxi in to the gate were normal. Follow-me truck was waiting for taxi in as requested. Logbook write-up made. Thorough verbal debrief completed with ZZZ1 Maintenance personnel.
Aircraft,I worked four flights on aircraft X on Date as the A flight attendant. Shortly after take off; both C and I noticed there was a very loud noise coming from the left side front entry door next to my right ear sitting at the jump seat. Once we reached 10;000 feet; I asked C to request assistance from one of our deadheading captains to access if the door seal is intact. That deadheading Captain heard the noise and access the door seal to be safe. I called flight deck and inform our Captain of the situation and he said the door look safe from their indicators too and would call for maintenance to meet us in ZZZ.Once we landed in ZZZ; the Captain showed me a piece of metal that maintenance confirmed belongs on the outside of the door hinge area. Maintenance told us he couldn't do the repair and it must wait until end of day at ZZZ1. That noise got louder with each flight and by the third flight; I was unable to hear the accent 10;000 foot chime and was able to make the PA only because I visually saw the light. I warned B of this so when both C and I couldn't hear the 10;000 foot chime on the fourth flight; B made the PA from the back for us. B and C used their apple watches and were able to record the noise level at up to 107 decibels during cruise. I have pictures of this. Half way through the work day I developed a severe headache and by the end of the day my hearing; especially my right; feels compromised like it has a cotton ball in it. I have learned from crew working on that same aircraft today that the noise problem is still there today.
Human Factors,The reason for the unairworthy aircraft was the MGT (Measured Gas Temperature) gauge displayed an exceedance when the aircraft battery switch was on. However; the aircraft never actually had an exceedance. It was due to a known issue with that specific manufacture part number. It had happened in the past to this particular aircraft multiple times over the course of a few months and was always addressed when it made an appearance.Where I did wrong and the reason for this report is due to the fact that I flew the aircraft with that exceedance still in the system. I had noticed right after turning the battery switch on that the exceedance was displayed on the MGT gauge. I thought to myself it could have been impossible as I had never exceeded any limits during start. To add to this; during preflight at the beginning of my shift; I did not see any exceedances displayed in any of the gauges or on the system in general. For that reason coupled with the fact that this aircraft has done this exact thing before due to known issue in the part number was the reason I wrongfully decided to clear the exceedance and proceed to fly to my destination not only once but twice. I pushed the clear button on two separate occasions for two different flights with two different start ups. It was not the right thing to do. At the time I did not think I was in the wrong as I knew it wasn't indicating an exceedance prior to the flight or even during my preflight. It was until the second flight on my way back to the destination. I started to think to myself and was viewing it from a different point of view. A point of view of a mechanic; an FAA rep; or just plainly another pilot and what I thought of was very simple. The helicopter is throwing an exceedance code and it's telling me something is wrong. Therefore; it should have been grounded and the thought of is it real or not should have died then and there. It isn't up to me to justify on moving forward or finding a solution on whether it's a real exceedance or not. The moment I saw an 'E' on the MGT gauge should have been the moment I wrote up a discrepancy and let the Mechanics figure out the problem. As soon as I got to base; I stuck it in the hangar and did the right thing by calling our Maintenance department to take care of the discrepancy.The next morning I got a hold of my Supervisor and I told him what happened which in turn; rightfully made it up the chain to our Chief Pilot. It was in the best interest that I get sent back to [home base] and get remedial training for my decision and actions that one night. On top of the additional training; I will also be written up on our companies 'Performance Improvement Plan.' I have learned not to justify anything regardless if it is right or wrong; even if it's a true exceedance or not. Not just with exceedances but this applies to every single aspect surrounding us in the aviation community. Procedures; Limitations; Emergency and normal procedures are all put in place for our safety. All these are black and white and very clear in what is right or wrong. This incident which in turn; would make me safer in the future. This will be a lesson learned from here on out in my career. A lesson that I will carry on my shoulders and be told for years to come. I am one to speak up about times like this as someone else might not make the same mistake as I did that night.
Weather,I was assigned to fly a charter flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ on the morning of DATE. Weather for the trip was variable; as I recall; with good VFR in ZZZ2; and possible lower conditions west of ZZZ2 toward the destination. I chose to fly the last segment of the trip VFR; because the weather looked acceptable; based on conditions at departure time; and I wanted the flexibility to maneuver around and change plans at the destination.  I asked for a runway condition report from Flight Service before departure; but they said there was no report in the system. I chose to depart with the intention of getting a runway condition report en-route; and land at ZZZ2 if no report was available.The initial part of the flight was uneventful; but approaching ZZZ2; I asked ATC again for a condition report. They read me a report of 8 inches of wet snow on the runway. Based on this report; I decided to land in ZZZ2; and wait for better conditions.  Flying into ZZZ2; I called the company agent in ZZZ2; and asked if he had any information from other pilots about runway conditions in ZZZ. He indicated that the ZZZ maintenance contractor was probably plowing the runway already. Based on this info; I decided to continue; with the intention of calling the plow operator on the radio approaching ZZZ; and getting an up to date report. If I was unable to talk with the plow operator; then we would just turn back and land at ZZZ2.  About 20 miles out from ZZZ; the plow operator answered my radio call; and said that he had just started plowing. He said that he would have the runway plowed full length in about 15 minutes. He said he would do 2 passes and that would be plenty wide enough. I decided to circle over the low terrain in the valley east of ZZZ while the plow operator finished the job. Returning to ZZZ2 to wait would have meant about 20 minutes of flying back to ZZZ2; and a further 20 minutes to ZZZ again.  I flew a few circles about 10 miles east of ZZZ; and the plow operator called back on the radio; to say that he had just finished the full length of the runway.  The weather was variable. Ceiling was indefinite; with reported ceiling at ZZZ between 1;000 and 1;500 ft. Visibility east of ZZZ was variable between about 2 and 5 miles with snow showers. ZZZ was reporting visibility between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 miles; so I was expecting the visibility to go down as I approached ZZZ.  I set up the airplane for landing; and lined up on final approach for Runway XX. About 2 miles out; I got sight of the town and the runway on the far side of the river. The light was dim; with light snow and the terrain was visually featureless. The runway area was a field of uniform white; but I turned on the runway lights; and could make them out clearly enough.  I aimed for the center between the runway lights; descended; started the landing flare; and pulled the power back to idle. Just at touchdown; the left main wheel descended into the berm on the left side of the runway; and the airplane started yawing to the left. I applied hard right rudder to keep the airplane under control and steer toward the plowed portion of the runway. The airplane then yawed to the right; onto the plowed portion of the runway. But there was not enough traction or rudder authority to stop the yaw to the right. The airplane slid down the runway while decelerating and yawing approximately 180 degrees to the right.  The main wheels probably got enough traction while moving backwards to pull the airplane to the east side of the runway; because the airplane came to rest in the snow berm on the east side of the runway; having yawed a total of about 270 degrees. The event involved smooth; rapid deceleration; but no impacts or abrupt motions. I did not notice any change in engine sound or operation during the event.  The engines were still running at idle when the airplane stopped moving. I shut down the engines and secured the airplane normally.  We dug out a path in the snow to pull theairplane out; and I taxied it onto the ramp. The ramp had only been partially plowed; and flat light conditions still prevailed; so I walked the path to the ramp before taxi; and noted a route that would get the airplane safely off the runway. I taxied the airplane slowly onto the ramp; but I could not see the berms on the ramp while taxiing; and inadvertently ran the right main wheel slowly into a berm at an angle. I stopped the airplane and shut it down as soon as I felt the wheel start to drag. The right propeller contacted the soft wet snow at about 2-3 knots forward speed; and at idle power (about 1;000 RPM). The propeller displaced some snow; but this did not slow down the engine and put no significant load on the propeller.  There were no other anomalies in engine operations or aircraft taxiing. I then called our Director of Operations (DO) on a borrowed satellite phone. I described the event and situation to him; and did a preliminary assessment of the airplane. I did not see any evidence of damage or structural deformation; and I passed that information to him. He told me to do a thorough inspection; and if I found any evidence of structural issues; they would send a maintenance crew out to assess it. He said that if I was satisfied with the condition of the aircraft; then I could fly it back to ZZZ1.  Some snow had been thrown up into the wheel wells during the event; so I removed the snow and inspected the condition of the landing gear hardware and attachments. I also did a visual assessment of the straightness and parallelism of the landing gear system.  I found no evidence of any structural deformation. I looked for: deformation or bending of the landing gear struts and links; cracks of any kind; bending; buckling or oil-canning of the skins; [and] any evidence of deformation (such as cracked paint) at the interfaces between brackets and primary aircraft structure. I found none of these.  The aircraft wing flaps were retracted during initial shutdown; per normal procedure. Some snow was apparently trapped between the left flap and wing; which compressed and re-froze. I removed as much of the snow and ice as possible; with help from one of the passengers; but we were unable to get the flaps to move from their retracted position.  I also walked up the runway to see what I could learn from the runway condition. I found the groove in the snow; where the left main wheel first contacted the snow berm. It started a few feet outside of the face of the snow berm; but well within the line of the runway lights and tracked towards the runway centerline. I found no tracks of the wheels on the plowed surface of the runway; and no evidence of the airplane contacting the right side (west side) berm. It is clear that the airplane was on the runway surface during the entire event.  I walked up to the runway threshold; and found that the plowed section of the runway was not centered in the space between the runway lights. I paced off the distance from the berm on each side to the innermost runway threshold light. The berm on the west side of the runway was 5 paces (about 15 feet) in from the innermost threshold light; while the berm on the east side was 10 paces (about 30 feet) in from the innermost threshold light.   In addition; the berm on the east side appeared to curve toward the runway centerline as it progressed in the landing direction on Runway XX.  So while landing on Runway XX; the left side berm was closer to the runway centerline than the right side berm. I was a bit off runway centerline to the left; and the left berm was off center to the right. This combination; along with the flat light conditions caused the left main wheel to contact the berm during touchdown.  I returned to the ramp and called back the DO. I reviewed my observations and plans with him. I planned to take the airplane up solo and fly around the pattern; to assess its condition and operation. I then planned to fly to ZZZ2 for more fuel. I planned to not retract the landing gear; for fear of the moisture in the landing gear hardware (wet snow and water) freezing at altitude and rendering some piece of hardware inoperative. Both takeoff and landing with flaps up are normal operations for the aircraft; and the planned runways were adequate for flaps-up operations; so I elected to proceed; even though the wing flaps were inoperative. The DO concurred with my plans; and I consulted with my passengers and got their agreement; so that's what we did. We returned to ZZZ1 with no further difficulties.
Human Factors,Aircraft X arrived as flight from ZZZ. The flight crew reported the right Nose cowl anti-ice valve illuminated in flight. Company Maintenance Control was notified and the decision to place it on Mel 30-00-XX-X; with associated Mel 36-00-XX. The AMM references were received and the right engine was opened to lock the nose cowl anti ice valve in the open position and the high stage valve in the closed position. The AMM calls for the cannon plug to the TAI (Thermal Anti Ice) pressure switch to be disconnected. While in the process of completing the MEL procedure I was receiving maintenance call from our other business partners. I disconnected the cannon plug for the anti ice valve instead of the pressure switch. The high stage valve was locked closed and engine cowls closed. The log book signed and aircraft released for service. The aircraft left the gate and returned to gate after EICAS warning. Upon arrival back to gate the right engine fan cowl was opened. The anti ice valve cannon plug reconnected and the TAI pressure switch cannon plug disconnected per the AMM. The engine fan cowl was closed and the logbook signed. The root cause for this incident was the distraction of the incoming maintenance calls and not going back three steps to make sure the proper cannon plug was disconnected. The aircraft left the gate and the fight arrived to ZZZ without further problems.
Human Factors,Aircraft released via Redmond SID and heading 170. Pilot checked on after departure correctly and I issued 'radar contact; leaving 7;000 [direct] SUNBE (couple hundred miles south) and restated climb to 140;00.' Read back was marginal with '[direct] SUNBE; maintain 14;000'. No alt to make turn so my assumption is he's going direct now. I restated 'SUNBE at 7;000 please' and he said to effect 'garbled... sorry SUNBE cross 7;000 and then 14;000 after that.' Typically; the aircraft is not even close to our Minimum Vectoring Altitude to go on course if Tower ships them in a timely manner at that point. Typically the jet will be on course in around 12 to 15 miles from departure. While this was going on I had several VFR practice approaches and VFR aircraft so my attention was drawn to potential conflict. I called in the blind for VFR aircraft as well as Tower. Somehow I missed that this jet actually read back fix 'cross' at 7;000 which would never in my years have made sense. I'm surprised that the pilot did not query me. 7;000 feet for 200+ miles or something like that then climb? Despite being distracted with the conflict potential and the fact that I heard fix; alt and top alt I trusted what I heard was issued. After the pilot asked when I came back online from the Tower I realized what may have happened and at that point reissued top altitude and for him to continue climb to my next higher terrain. On my part; hearing the crossing word had implications for sure. On the pilot side; the responsibility of accepting a clearance should have some weight.
Airport,IAH at night and positioned at Spot XX on North Ground frequency 118.57.  North Ground Control issued clearance to Runway 33L via - NB left on ND right on NC hold short of NR call Ground on 121.7. Ground Control on 121.7 subsequently asked us to follow an aircraft on taxiway WB (near WW) and follow Aircraft Y on WB to Runway 33L.I began to make a left turn on NE to join WB at WW as there are no taxi lanes on the ground from NC to WB.  Ground Control asked why we were turning left. We attempted to explain that there was no defined path for his instruction.  At night with no painted center lines to follow; (and as typical for the Aircraft X a nose taxi light that is only marginally better than a candle) it appeared that we may depart the hard surface and end up in the grass or dirt. It was only when I turned on my landing and runway turnoff lights that I could see there was hard surface between NC and WB.There are no painted taxi lines between these taxiways. I rarely allow the nose wheel to depart a centerline unless I am maneuvering in a holding pad. The only guarantee that you are not encroaching on other aircraft or obstacles is to ensure that your aircraft is over a center line. There needs to be painted taxi lanes between these two taxiways if there is going to be a clearance from one to the other.
Human Factors,Class 9 Hazmat spill in pit 3; I notified supervisor over radio Supervisor advised me not to load aircraft until the pit was clean by proper personnel. Assistant Manger  arrives on scene and orders my crew to clean up spill. Customer Service boarded without knowledge of situation on ramp and left gate check bags on crowding bridge door. I contacted Load Planning to get more weight in rear to accommodate bags and inform them about our situation. After loading about 40 bags in the rear we had to put the rest of the bags in PIT 3.
Ambiguous,Cruise ....wake turbulence caused an aircraft over speed. Mach 0.83 for three (3) seconds.I can't really give an answer to help prevent this occurrence. It is not uncommon for this to happen and cannot be addressed until it occurs. Once it occurs we can make certain changes such as changing altitude or flight path.
Ambiguous,On vectors for approach 18R at Memphis we received continuous; erroneous; EGPWS warnings once we crossed the river on a 9 mile dogleg to final. These warnings continued to touchdown. 'RA' warning flag was on and off in the Captain and First Officer PFD. Both A/Ps were engaged. I suspect 5G interference.
Aircraft,During takeoff from ZZZ we observed air noise and an odor coming from the cabin. The FO (First Officer) said it smelled hot while for me it smell like bleed air. We were at v1 so we continued. After takeoff the cabin duct overheat CAS appeared. We were cleared to 4000 ft; but requested to level at 3000 ft to sort things out. We were VMC so we told the Controller we needed to return and had the airport in sight. We were cleared for the visual and told to contact the Tower.The CAS light disappeared after turning the cabin temp knob to full cold and reducing power. We decided to burn fuel off instead of an overweight landing. We coordinated with the Tower to circle north of the airport. While circling we maintained 250 ias to burn down fuel quicker in case we had to land immediately.After slowing for landing we found that at 185 kts with the gear and flaps down could have burned fuel off just as quick as 250 with the boards out. That would have been an option to stay below 200 in the class D.
Human Factors,Aircraft X departing ZZZ to ZZZ1. We finished boarding and I heard the Flight Attendants struggling to get the Main Cabin Door closed. After multiple tries; I left the flight deck to see what was going on and try it myself. Multiple more attempts; we could not get the door to close and I contacted Maintenance to write it up. They instructed me that this was a recurring issue with this aircraft. After writing it up; Contract Maintenance arrived at the aircraft and started troubleshooting the issue. They were able to get it closed and latched; but I mentioned that the FAs (Flight Attendants) should be able to close it. The Contract Maintenance was in touch with Maintenance Control and was told that it was likely due to uneven ramp surface and that if it closed; they would ops test it good. We moved the aircraft back a little bit and still encountered the same issue. Contract Maintenance realized that there was something wrong with the handle or door as well and the Flight Attendants were still not comfortable with it. They insisted something was still wrong. I told Contract Maintenance that I was not okay with an ops test good because it was an emergency exit door and was not working properly; whether it closed or not. After urging them to further troubleshoot it; Maintenance Control instructed them to remove a panel and check a cable. They inspected it and found that the Ice Breaker Cable was snapped. They explained that this cable was to assist the external handle open in the event that it iced over during flight. Without this cable; it could possibly not open during an emergency and no one would know about it. This aircraft flew multiple times after being written up multiple times and being ops tested good previous times. Fortunately; we urged them to dig into it further and corrected a huge safety issue.We should not be so quick to perform ops [checks] and mark them successful without troubleshooting further. Maintenance Control complacency on understanding this is an emergency exit and should be thoroughly troubleshooted. They assumed incorrectly and could have resulted in life threatening consequences in the event of an emergency.
Ambiguous,We were taking off from GSO and upon departure we received an amber RA; APPR2 NOT AVAIL EICAS MESSAGE; and VA DOOM message on MFD MAP page. Once everything cleared we reported it to tower as a possible 5G interference. Weather was low IFR and during the takeoff phase of flight we got super busy. I accidentally forgot to write it up in the maintenance logbook. On Date I was advised by Name from flight ops about the 5G report and that the FAA investigated the incident and noticed that the report was not written in the maintenance logbook. Name then advised me to fill out a Report.Mitigation's to prevent me from forgetting to write up a 5G interference in the maintenance logbook is to keep up to date and review the 5G reports provided by the company on [the] app. If any questions arise use the available resources provided. For example; calling Operations or Maintenance for guidance.
Aircraft,After boarding the A Flight Attendant told me about the forward galley service door being closed but that he could see daylight in the cracks. And that he unsuccessfully tried to recycle it a couple of times and eventually the First Officer (FO) managed to get it closed correctly. He also told me he heard a ramp agent tell the pilots about potential damage to the aircraft but they said all was good. He could not quite understand the technical terms so not much info is known about this. Upon ascent both the A and I heard a sharp whistling noise coming from the forward service door so the A called the pilots who said the pressurization looked good. Upon descent though we both heard and felt a loud rumbling noise and felt vibration on our feet. We could not quite figure out which if any of the forward doors it was coming from. He called the pilots and notified them and they said they heard nothing. While deplaning a few passengers mentioned there being a very loud noise as far back as row X. We both mentioned to the pilots that passengers heard the same noise we did. The A requested maintenance but the pilots said it looked good and it was probably a piece of rubber that could make that sound. The flight to ZZZ1 was uneventful. We did tell the Operations Agent about what we heard during ascent and descent. Thankfully he called for maintenance who then said the aircraft was unsafe to fly and it was taken out of service. I was not there at the time but the A contacted me and told me the Operations [Agent] reached out to him and updated him on what was happening. It needs to be mentioned that the pilots were both commuters.
Aircraft,Descending through approximately 12000 ft the #1 Flight Attendant advised us of an odor in the forward cabin. The odor soon became apparent in the cockpit. It was a sweet; pungent odor. Upon gate arrival; I entered the odor in the maintenance logbook; submitted a smoke odor fume form; notified Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and the Duty Pilot. No passengers reported being affected.
Aircraft,During service I had a strong odor in cabin and felt dizzy and lightheaded (note: I have been having these symptoms for months so I'm not able to tell if they are related; I'd assume most likely not). I told the #2 I would most likely write a [report]. I have been going through conflicts with my Manager and she recently informed me that she was going to reprimand me after I wrote a report for passenger misconduct (passenger continued to harass me after I told him that I couldn't breathe [because] I was having difficulty wearing a mask). Thinking about recent events with my Manager (and past incidents where I was also heavily interrogated after being severely harassed by coworkers) made me scared to file a report for the odor in fear of my Manager and/or crew members. During final descent (FWD facing jumpseat) I looked down the aisle; felt light headed; clammy; short of breathe and like everything was funneling in. I left my jumpseat and puked in the lav after landing and during taxi in. I came out to disarm my door and then leaned myself on the jumpseat to compose myself. At that point I heard the #2's phone make a sound like she was snapping a picture. I went back into the lav and puked again. I do not remember bits and pieces; especially as I was leaving the plane and jet bridge.
Procedure,I was working the radar position at Sector XX without a D-side. Traffic volume was high and increasing throughout my time at [Sector] XX. At the time; I had numerous aircraft transitioning my airspace southwest bound requiring a point out or hand off to sector(s) XX; XY; and YY. In addition to the high traffic volume we had flow restrictions going into ZZZ that added to my workload. When I saw the PVD indicator in the data blocks of the aircraft transitioning my airspace southwest bound I assumed that Sector YX had a data block. I was correct on all but Aircraft Y; who was not PVD'd to YX for reasons unknown to me. Maybe I mistyped the sector number? I don't know. But I did not catch it because I was busy and did not verify that YX had accepted the Point Out by clicking on the PVD indicator or checking the URET (User Request Evaluation Tool).Ultimately; the data block popped at Sector XX's boundary and began flashing with Aircraft X who had been issued FL290. Aircraft X was climbing through FL240 at the time and the radar controller issued an amended altitude clearance of FL270. A traffic call was issued to both aircraft.Our staffing is not adequate to provide the support we need on position in the form of D-sides or trackers. We are not afforded enough break time in between being on position. We do not have enough CPC's to properly staff the area.Management and TMU (Traffic Management Unit) are not doing their jobs by slowing traffic down to manageable levels for the amount of staffing in the area.Our low staffing has also resulted in excessive overtime assignments in the area leading to burnout and/or work fatigue.
Airport,Lighting on the ramp at JAN isn't just inadequate it's completely absent. There is no ramp lighting at all. Parking center line is impossible to see. I imagine doing a walkaround is dangerous for a Pilot due to lack of lighting and potential tripping hazards. Ramp Personnel explained to me that they have been begging the airport for lighting improvements since the station was reopened.  It needs addressed immediately.
Human Factors,I have asked my Relief Pilot to inspect the main deck after loading was completed. He brought to my attention stacking issues with pallet position RL. I have asked ZZZ Load Master to address his concerns and delayed departure until the issues was fixed. After landing ZZZ1; ground personnel offloaded position RL and RR and we learned that pallet position SR collapsed into pallet position SL. Both S position were hazardous lithium batteries.
Aircraft,During cruise flight at FL350; FLT CTRL SYS B became inoperative. We completed QRH procedures which directed us to place the FLT CTRL B switch to RUD STBY. This also created additional failures in Diff Feel and Yaw Damper Fail. We also noticed that 'A' system hydraulic fluid appeared to be decreasing. Since we were not yet halfway and about to go on a portion of our trip completely over water for approximately 500 miles; we elected to turn around to divert back to ZZZ. We considered diverting 300 miles to ZZZ1 and looked at other potential diversion points on the return to ZZZ. We were going to be approximately 2;000 pounds overweight; so we [requested priority handling] in accordance with the FOM and company policy. During the approach the flight controls were sluggish. The approach and landing were completed per the 737 QRH Overweight Landing Checklist; and an overweight landing entry made in addition to the SYS B Failure in the a/c logbook.Suggestions - I think the 737 QRH needs to be reviewed for additional steps on this item. Very brief. Doesn't mention that follow on failures will occur including loss of Yaw Damper and Feel Diff. Additionally there is no information in QRH Overweight Landing Checklist that indicates[requesting priority handling] is required per company policy.
Ambiguous,Seattle Center cleared our flight to descend pilot discretion from FL340 to FL240. Within moments the Captain initiated the descent using altitude intervene. We were within 50 miles of top of descent and the cruise descent rate initiated at 1000 feet per minute. Within a minute Seattle Center gave us a frequency change and we checked in with a new Controller. Approximately 60 seconds after checking in with the new Controller we observed an Airbus 380 at our 10 o'clock. It had flown across our path from right to left (we were traveling NW bound on the Chins arrival) at what I would guess was FL360. We were descending through an altitude of approximately FL300 when we observed the Airbus 380. About 60 seconds later we encountered residual wake turbulence from the Airbus 380. About 20 seconds later the A Flight Attendant called over the interphone to indicate she may be injured. She requested medical attention upon arrival and after deplaning. Immediately following the Flight Attendant call I informed Seattle Center of the wake turbulence and possible injuries on the aircraft. About 60 seconds later we were contacted by Seattle Center inquiring about the details of our encounter and severity of injuries. I then initiated contact with Dispatch to relay the request for medical attention. I then followed up with Operations when we were on the ground and clear of the runways that medical staff would be present at our gate. Upon arrival at the gate; medical staff was present. Passengers deplaned; and all of the flight attendants requested to be examined by medical staff.Seattle Center never made us aware of the Airbus 380 traffic and because we were in a descent and well below the altitude of the [Airbus] 380; we were not alerted. I will be more vigilant looking for traffic during descents when my vision is blocked by the airframe with pitch attitudes different than cruise. And I recommend extra vigilance by ATC when the Airbus 380 is in the vicinity of other aircraft. They are rare to see and their wake turbulence profile is much larger than even I expected. This event was my first encounter with the Airbus 380.
Ambiguous,Clear skies; winds 340/3; temp -7. Deiced trace frost at the Gate. Good weather and no convective activity through local area. We departed Runway 30 and passing approximately 100 kts. there was a predictive wind shear warning. After a quick mental assessment of local conditions and the possibility of a high speed abort I opted to continue. We had no secondary indications; no fluctuations in airspeed or reports from the recently departed air carrier in front of us. During departure we experienced no anomalies.I've done two go-arounds over the last few weeks (one for low weather and one for an unstable approach) and experienced the same operational stresses that everyone else has recently but this was one of my toughest decisions in recent memory. I know what the manual says regarding predictive windshear guidance but the FO (First Officer) and I debriefed out of 10;000 feet and we were both in agreement that under the circumstances; with the conditions we were encountering; that continuing was the best course of action.
Airport,During pushback from gate; our tug became disconnected from the tow-bar while simultaneously communication over headsets with our tug driver was lost. Just prior to this occurring; we were in a normal pushback towards taxiway Alpha; tail south and had been cleared to start engines. We had begun to start engine one but as the pushback progressed towards the service road area; it seemed that our tug driver was starting to have some difficulty maneuvering the aircraft and that they were getting some slippage which prompted us to shut the engine down. We were now well clear of the gate area with the aircraft positioned around the non-movement/movement line for taxiway Alpha across from Quebec taxiway. The tug had been maneuvering so that it was positioned to the right of the aircraft nose and was not readily visible from the flight deck when the aircraft began moving forward.The aircraft movement still felt like it was being controlled by the tug and we had not received any warning that the tug had detached. Our First Officer caught sight of the tug to the right and behind his position which was the first indication that the tug had disconnected. In response; our First Officer applied his toe brakes; the aircraft came to a stop and the parking brake was set. It wasn't immediately apparent from the flight deck that the tug had contacted the airframe as we did not feel an obvious impact. Our First Officer opened his window to get a better view and he confirmed that the tug had contacted the airframe and was resting between the fuselage and front of the right engine nacelle. We communicated this information to BOS Operations + BOS ground Control and emergency services was contacted.The impact was more readily felt from the cabin and while we were still assessing the situation we received a call from our FA 1 who stated that they were getting a fuel smell in the cabin. Still not knowing the condition of the aircraft and the source of the smell; I asked our FA 1 to have the cabin crew at stations. After communicating with emergency services personal outside; verifying we did not have a fuel leak and that we would be able to return to a gate; I contacted the cabin crew and informed them the smell was likely from the discontinued engine start; posed no danger and that we would be returning to a gate for normal deplaning. Once the tug which had impacted our aircraft was moved; we were towed back to the gate and deplaned normally. No customers or crew were injured. The incident was reported to the appropriate personnel per our Flight Operations Manual and a maintenance logbook entry was made.
Aircraft,For me this event occurred one my 3rd leg of the day on day 5 of 6.  For this flight; we were originally supposed to have Aircraft Y.  When we got to the aircraft Maintenance was onboard investigating an open write up that previous crews had reported; fumes of unknown origin.  Maintenance couldn't find the issue and we were assigned a new plane. We arrived to Aircraft X and soon departed.  On climb out just after rotation; the captain and I noticed a smell but we both thought it was from the [prior aircraft] that took off prior to us. The smell went away quickly.Just before beginning the descent I had started to develop a slight headache. Upon starting descent a few moments later; we both started to smell the smell again.   At this time the Captain said he had a headache and I responded that I had one as well.  He then said he wanted to try something and gave me the radios (I was Pilot Flying and he was Pilot Monitoring) and donned the O2 mask for a couple of breaths. Then put his headset on and asked me to do the same.  I took a couple of breaths from the mask and instantly felt better. I realized at that time we were definitely experiencing fumes of some unknown origin in the flight deck and that it wasn't us just being paranoid because of the fact that our original plane we were supposed to fly had this exact issue written up.  I took my mask off and could really smell the fumes.  I told the Captain I instantly felt better on the O2 and I can really smell the fumes now.The Captain immediately called for Smoke/Fire/Fumes QRC.  At this time we were already descending on the STAR into our destination (maybe 15 min out).  Captain took over the aircraft and radios while I ran the QRC then QRH.  We started the QRH and requested special handling with ATC.  The Captain called the FAs (Flight Attendants) and informed them of the situation and they could not smell any fumes in the cabin.  We asked ATC to notify our Dispatch for us.  We continued on with the QRH and stopped the QRH when we got to 'RAT Manual Deploy Lever ........ PULL'.  We agreed to stop the QRH as we were less then 10min out from landing and did not want to put ourselves in an electrical emergency situation. Shortly after; we entered icing conditions and 'ICE CONDITION' along with 'STALL PROT ICE SPEEDS' appeared on EICAS. After loading ice speeds in we got a master caution for 'A-I WING FAIL'. After identify/cancel; Captain called for A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We then realized the bleeds were out from the SMOKE/FIRE/FUMES QRH and stopped the A-I WING FAIL QRH.  We broke out of the clouds about 5 seconds later and landed safely within a couple of minutes.  We were met on the ground by Crash Fire Rescue and notified them that we did not need any assistance and were good to continue to the gate.
Aircraft,After landing at ZZZ; taxi into Gate XX (using SafeDock with GO at the switch) progressed normally to a stop. Using normal Captain's flow; I checked accumulator pressure; set the parking brake (I don't recall if I saw hydraulic pressure on the triple indicator); turned OFF the seat belt sign and switched Engine Master 2 to OFF. The First Officer noted 'I think we're moving; we're moving!'. At this time I noticed movement as well and applied immediate braking to the rudder pedals and stopped the aircraft. We maintained pressure on the rudder pedals to keep the aircraft from moving. I verified that the parking brake handle was ON; but there was no accumulator pressure or Parking Brake memo. I cycled the parking brake handle three times with no change. I coordinated with Maintenance Control and Ground Operations. This is when I learned that the #1 engine pylon had struck the bottom of the jet bridge. GO (Ground Operations) chocked the nose wheels. I started the APU; turned the Yellow Hydraulic Pump ON (to assure hydraulic pressure) and then shut down Engine #1. After engine shut down; we noted the Parking Brake memo was now present and with with pressure showing on the accumulator; we turned off the Yellow Electric Pump. This made me doubt my belief that I saw Yellow Accumulator pressure when I did my flow before setting the Parking Brake. We went outside to see any aircraft damage and noted a dent on the top of the #1 Engine pylon where it contacted the jet bridge. I made two write-ups in the logbook for parking brake failure and damage to the pylon.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On approach into LAX at 2;500 feet we had a near mid air with a large yellow drone. It passed just below and left of the nose/wing. We notified ATC and landed normally. Post flight inspection by both pilots and maintenance showed no impact.
Aircraft,Arrived at ZZZ maintenance facility to reposition aircraft to ZZZ1. Accomplished full originating/acceptance checklists. Completed fully all normal checklists prior to takeoff. No unresolved discrepancies. Normal takeoff with flex power. (However; we did not shut down APU until just prior to take off; thus PACKS were on APU till that point). Immediately after 'Positive rate; gear up; speed mode' the cockpit filled suddenly with smoke of moderate density. The smoke had a distinct smell that comes only from the PACKS and definitely NOT electrical or fuel. We discussed and shut off PACKS and dumped cabin to clear smoke as we were at low altitude. While climbing we advised Tower of the smoke and requested remain in the pattern for return to field. He asked if we were declaring an emergency and we replied NO; NOT AT PRESENT. ( the same reply we gave to all subsequent questions ). We referenced EPC and QRH. On downwind we got a SMOKE FWD LAV warning and audio. First Officer got up to inspect lav and found it was only from the residual cockpit smoke and no fire was present. Also checked aft lav. Warning indication on EICAS went away. Returned to cockpit discussed all relevant circumstances and determined the threat was managed and ZZZ1 (10 minutes away) offered better maintenance and rescue and fire facilities. Made low approach to runway and coordinated with ATC and proceeded to ZZZ1 uneventfully. (PACKS remained OFF).
Aircraft,On Date Aircraft X flying from ZZZ to ZZZZ; on climbout about 40 minutes into the flight we leveled at FL270 but we were in bumpy weather and in and out of the clouds. We asked ATC for a climb to get above the clouds we were given Flight Level 350. We proceeded to climb to FL350 and turned on the Engine Anti Ice around 270 being in and out of the clouds and the temp was -15C (AT NO time did we ever turn on the Wing Anti Ice). Climbing through FL320 just passed ZZZ1 over the ocean we had a Master Caution/Wing Body Overheat light. I; the Captain; was the Flying Pilot and at once said MY AIRCRAFT and the First Officer got out the checklist to accomplish the Wing Body Overheat emergency/ (my aircraft and radios). The First Officer completed the checklist (did a great job); [received priority] and were going to divert to ZZZ1. After First Officer completed the checklist and the Wing Body Heat light went out we decided to return to ZZZ. ATC gave us direct to ZZZ and I transferred controls to the First Officer and I began to coordinate with ATC; and inform the Flight Attendants; the passengers and Dispatch. While flying back to ZZZ we had to land [overweight]. We chose the longest runway at ZZZ [Runway] XXC and completed the Landing Assessment on the Landing APP; and had plenty of runway to stop the overweight aircraft. Our gross weight on landing XXC ZZZ was 162 kts. and the fuel on board was 30.6k and we landed 40 Flaps 147 knots approach speed. The First Officer landed the aircraft and transferred controls at 60 knots. Exited XXC with no incident and had the Fire Chief take a look at the aircraft on the taxiway. The Fire Chief reported no issues with the aircraft and then taxied back to the gate and filled out the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook) with overweight landing and Wing Body Overheat. Thanks for all the ATC controllers help and the emergency personnel. Thanks to the great professionalism of my First Officer and the calmness of our 4 Flight Attendants. Thanks to the Chief Pilot meeting us at the aircraft. Special thanks to all of the training instructors and Check Airmen who prepare us for situations such as the one we experienced.
Airport,On taxi-in; when we attempted to turn left from D onto the ramp toward gate X as depicted on the taxi diagram and gate diagram pages; Ground Control informed us that we were turning the wrong way. We quickly determined that all of the gate numbering on the taxi diagram (20-9); airport moving-map page; and Parking Gates and Coordinates page is incorrect. Jeppesen data is incorrect. Better coordination between airport authorities and chart data providers.
Aircraft,On departure at 10;000 feet; Flight Attendant called the cockpit to report odor in the cabin and one Flight Attendant sick. We [requested ATC priority handling]; ran appropriate checklists and returned to ZZZ. Upon arrival to the gate medical personnel assisted.
Human Factors,During the Hazmat [preflight] inspection I discovered a flammable liquid box that was crushed on the bottom of the stack. There were no fumes or spillage; but the box had 'do not stack' on the side and we determined it was not safe to transport in its condition after having a discussion with DG personnel. It was removed and we continued the flight after a 35 min delay. Cause - Improper loading of hazardous cargo.Suggestions - Properly load cargo. Pay attention to hazardous goods documentation.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Cleveland Runway 24R departure. While on takeoff and climbout; the First Officer's radar altimeter remained at 0 to -5 ft until reaching 3;700 feet MSL or approximately 2;500 feet AGL when it read correctly; then decluttered off our PFD. The Captain side radar altimeter read correctly the entire takeoff and departure. Departure Control was notified of the anomaly.Since ATC was notified; I planned on writing up my incident report at the hotel on the overnight from notes I had taken about the anomaly after takeoff. The radar altimeter operated normally into the next station. I have made an incident report regarding the radar altimeter suspected 5G anomaly.
Aircraft,International flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1; Pilot Flying; Captain on this flight. In cruise for approximately 10 minutes at FL310 when we received an EICAS message of HYD pump failure and a CAC (Cabin Air Compressor) shut down due to load shed.Ran checklist for HYD pump failure. No checklist for CAC load shed...multiple other electrical system failure/ load shed status messages.Called Company Dispatch and Maintenance Control on SAT phone. Discussed failures and systems affected by the multiple electrical system load shed items. Original source of failure was indicated as an electrical Transformer/Rectifier failure.Myself; Dispatch and Maintenance Control all agreed that a diversion was best course of action and to not continue on flight to ZZZ1. ZZZ was chosen as diversion airport.Fuel dump was required in order to land below max landing weight.Return to ZZZ coordinated with ZZZZ Center; fuel dump also approved by ZZZZ Center and initiated at FL310.Dual flight management computer (FMCs) failures also occurred after turn around to ZZZ.Dispatch coordinated new flight plan; landing data and station coordination for our ZZZ arrival.Normal descent; approach; landing at ZZZ on Runway XXR in VFR conditions. Taxi to gate and normal shutdown.Debriefed Dispatch; Chief Pilot; Company Operations Manager after shut down and checklists completed.
Aircraft,Deiced in ZZZ; about two hours into flight received a fuel config annunciation. Ran QRC; feeding out of center tanks at the time. Fuel flows even. Fuel imbalance was 1;600 lbs. between main fuel tanks; checklist had us balance. I then contacted Maintenance Control and Dispatch via SATCOM. Decision was to continue and monitor. As a precaution reviewed fuel leak procedure. Woke the Relief Officer and had him check wings and engine. Fluid was streaming out of spoiler area along whole left wing while right wing was dry. At first we thought deice fluid but with the aforementioned fuel configuration and imbalance beginning again we chose to divert to ZZZ1 after consulting First Officers and Dispatch and Maintenance Control via SATCOM a second time. Ran diversion guide and fuel leak procedure. [Requested priority handling] and landed uneventfully in ZZZ1. Stopped on taxiway and had Operations look for fuel leak prior to taxiing to gate. Parked at gate and handled passengers and contacted Chief Pilot. Fuel imbalance at shutdown was 1;000 lbs with the left wing low.
Human Factors,Aircraft X. ZZZ-ZZZ1; we had a pressurization issue in which [we advised ATC]. Captain was the PF (Pilot Flying) and the PM (Pilot Monitoring) was FO (First Officer). Once we got to the aircraft we began our checks. Which the CA (Captain) performed his final cockpit scan. Though it is not on the CA's final cockpit scan. With the experience through the years; I always check the manual pressurization knob to ensure the knob is in the 'DN' position. Which at that time; it was full counterclockwise 'DN'. At the beginning of the trip there was several things going on. Runway XX had a NOTAM for Runway XX FICON 6/2/5 25 PCT WET; 60 PCT 1/4IN WATER; 30 PCT WET OBS AT Date/Time; #4 brake indicator pins were close to wear; the aircraft had to be de-iced and there was an issue on getting the clearance with the FO. Due to the busy work load; I talked to Dispatch couple of times for obtaining the APA numbers for the NOTAM runway and Maintenance for the #4 brake as well as coordinated with ops for de-icing. While we were getting ready to de-ice; the FO called up the FA (Flight Attendant) to tell him we were beginning de-icing and when he got off the phone the FO stated he had a hard time hearing him.While climbing through 13;200 ft.; we noticed the cabin altitude was around 8;700 ft. and climbing. When I saw this; the statement refer to QRH cabin altitude in amber was cut off by triple chimes 'CABIN'. I immediately asked the FO to request a descent to 10;000 ft. FO asked me if the emergency descent checklist should be ran and I stated yes. We alerted the Center of the problem and told them that we will get back to them if we needed assistance. Once leveling at 10;000 ft.; the I noticed the cabin altitude was at 9;500 ft. At that point; I radioed Center; [requested priority handling] and requested a descent to 8;000 ft. The altitude was granted; descent was initiated; FA and Dispatch notified. Once leveled at 8;000 ft. we set up and reviewed for visual approach to Runway XXC and went through the rest of the normal checklist. When we were caught up with everything; I started troubleshooting in my mind the pressurization issue. The first place I looked was the pressurization controller to see if there was error codes to report back to Maintenance as well as the AUTO/MAN switch position to ensure the controller was in fact AUTO. After looking at the pressurization controller; I inspected the manual pressurization control knob and discovered the manual pressurization control knob was in the 1 O'clock position. The knob was turned back to the 'DN' position and normal pressurization resumed. Asking the FO how that happened. He told me that while trying to adjust the volume to hear the FA in ZZZ1; that the knob he turned and forgot to place knob position back to 'DN'. After FO admitted to turning the switch; I explained that the only way that the volume for the intercom can be adjusted; is through the PA amplifier in the forward nose compartment. The rest of the flight was uneventful. Was not aware that after the before start checklist was complete that the pressurization manual control knob was placed in the 1 O'clock position by the First Officer. The only thing would be to do is ensure by both pilots; the pressurization manual knob is in the 'DN' position while taking the active runway for departure.
Aircraft,Batt V 23.2 prior to start; initiated start and Batt V dropped to 13.4V but recovered quickly through 14V. Continued scan of VEMD; T4 rising normally; oil pressure check; and when scanning back to Batt V; noticed T4 needle moving quickly. Moved start selector to OFF and immediately noted OVERLIMIT DETECTED on upper VEMD. Accessed Maintenance pages and noted T4 of 871'C.Batteries that are cycled through show good voltage on preflight / before start checks; but how they will respond to a starter load is an unknown. Future first flight of day starts during cold weather / cold aircraft will be Start Pak assisted.
Aircraft,Bleed 1 & 2 Fault on upwind departing ZZZ. Leveled at 6000 ft. Completed Electronic Cockpit Aircraft Monitor procedure. Requested a return to [departure airport]. Accomplished follow up procedures. Regained bleeds and then lost again. Landed without incident. [We were in] Icing conditions.
Aircraft,After landing in ZZZZ on Runway XX we taxied to Gate XX. It was an uneventful landing and a relatively short taxi. We exited the runway at XY and we were told to taxi [Taxiway] XZ XA to Gate XX. After engine shutdown and completing both the Shutdown and Secure Checklists all four pilots were standing in business class waiting for the last few passengers to exit the aircraft. At this point Ground Personnel verbally informed us of a brake fire on the right side truck assembly. None of the Pilots were aware of this problem. The operating FO (First Officer) went to the Cockpit and the Captain; Relief Pilot and Maintenance proceeded to the ramp. When the three pilots arrived by the right side gear we noticed numerous Ground Personnel and Firemen. It appeared that the incident was over because the Foam had already been applied to the Truck assembly. The head Fireman told us it was the front part of the gear which equates to wheels #3 and #4 and that the temperature was now 400C. At least 5-6 Ground Personnel told us they only saw Smoke and no Fire and an equally number of different personnel told us they saw Flames. There didn't appear to be any damage to the airplane; gear doors; gear struts and the other tires. The FO who remained in the cockpit said the brake temperatures never got above 4.6 and that was brake #7. The other 5 temperatures on the right side were considerably lower. We didn't see any Company Maintenance personnel at the time. We later realized that another Air Carrier handled our maintenance operations in ZZZZ and Name was the only one working. So we made an AML entry describing what happened to the Gear and told Company Operations about the write up. The Captain called Company Maintenance in ZZZ after the incident but they already knew about the situation. The Chief Pilot from ZZZ1 also called us.The brake assembly of wheels #3 and #4 were recently replaced. We don't know if this played a part in the fire. Also ZZZ1 ramp had a lot of De Ice fluid and salt around Gate XY. We were wondering if this got caught up in the brakes and once the brakes were 'warmed up' after landing in ZZZZ this might have contributed to the fire.There is not any procedure or action that would have prevented this incident.
Aircraft,We departed ZZZ and once at a positive rate; I called for gear up. Right as my First Officer raised the gear handle we encountered a bump of light to moderate turbulence. After the gear retracted we received a steering inop caution message. We climbed towards 10;000 feet and once we were on course; away from terrain and caught up with flying the airplane I transferred flight controls and radios over to my FO (First Officer). We checked the QRC then went onto the QRH and performed the checklist but were unsuccessful.We then discussed a plan and decided to continue to ZZZ1 and land on [Runway] XXC as it was the longest runway and the winds were favorable. At this point I returned to PF (Pilot Flying) duties. We asked ZZZ Center to forward our request to ZZZ1 for planning purposes and advised them we were not an emergency; then texted Dispatch and filled in the flight attendants.Once with ZZZ Approach they elected to provide priority handling for us and vectored us into [Runway] XXC. We came to a full stop on the runway; I set the parking brake and made a PA to advise the passengers that the ARFF vehicles were precautionary and we were working on a maintenance issue. The system reset procedure was successful so we cancelled our emergency and taxied clear of the runway.
Aircraft,We were cleared to takeoff on Runway XXL; I advanced the thrust levers and rotated. Gear up; and at around 300 ft. AGL we received an engine fire (ECAM; triple chime; master caution; engine fire push button). Above 400 AGL we began ECAM actions; confirmed thrust lever 2 and I pulled it back. Centered the slide slip/beta target. 3 seconds later the ECAM disappeared. ATC told us level 2000; set A/P on and leveled 2000; pulled speed to slightly above green dot. Pulled HDG and turned crosswind. The Captain briefed the flight attendants then passengers. I had loaded the secondary for the ILS XXL in at the gate; so we activated the secondary flight plan. We transferred controls and I briefed the ILS XXL; exchanged back. The Captain noticed Engine #2 N1/N2 were still functional. I slowly added power back in and put #2 in the climb detent. Ran the approach checklist. Once cleared and configured we ran the landing checklist. landed.
Human Factors,We were descending on the NORDK 6 Arrival into SLC in excellent VMC meteorological conditions. During the Approach Briefing; I had thoroughly covered the terrain surrounding SLC; and reviewed the Class B airspace page and Jepp pages 19-01 through 08. Our speed was 210 kts. assigned. The moon overhead was within three days of full phase; so the terrain was illuminated very well. After passing ANNTY; the Approach Controller asked if we had the airport in sight; to which the Captain replied yes. We were then cleared for the visual approach to Runway 34L. To my recollection; I have always been vectored to the final approach course in SLC; even in visual conditions. Due to that expectation bias; I was a little surprised when we were cleared for the visual approach. We were pretty high on the downwind. I called for flaps 5 and in concurrence with the Captain; I set 6100 ft. in the MCP altitude selector and planned my descent to cross FFLAG at 6100 ft. As mentioned; the terrain was very well illuminated; so I proceeded to descend on downwind and base while visually maintaining terrain clearance with the terrain display as an additional reference. I asked the Captain to select FFLAG to LSK 1 of the LEGS page for vertical reference in the descent. As I was initiating my turn to base leg; the Tower Controller issued an Altitude Alert. The Controller asked if we had the terrain in sight; to which the Captain replied that we did. We were visually well clear of terrain and had no terrain concerns shown on the terrain display. Again; as a backup reference only; the terrain display indicated green ahead of our planned flight path at all times. We continued the descent and crossed FFLAG at 6100 ft. The rest of the approach and landing was uneventful. Although we had visual reference with the terrain at all times; it was very unsettling to receive the altitude/terrain advisory. Had there been an RNAV RNP approach to Runway 34L; I definitely would have requested it. Under the circumstances; I would have preferred vectors to the final approach course; prior to being cleared for the visual approach. A better course of action would have been to ask the Captain to request vectors to the final approach course. I also probably should have angled my downwind a little further to the left while descending. I am always cautious and mindful of terrain; and thought that I was allowing for adequate clearance. Because this occurrence was unsettling to me; in future similar situations I intend to allow for even more terrain clearance and utilize RNAV RNP approaches when available or request vectors to final.
Human Factors,Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1. I was the FO (First Officer) and the pilot monitoring and the Captain was the Pilot Flying. The time was approximately XA:25-XA:30 at ZZZ when we picked up the ASOS (Automated Surface Observing Systems). At the end of the ASOS there was a message from the Tower from last night stating that the Tower is closed after XQ00 local time and for IFR services to contact ZZZ Center. As we pulled out from the gate I announced on CTAF Frequency our intentions to taxi to Runway XX via Taxiway XX. We got a response from Tower saying the Tower is open and to contact Ground. We contacted Ground and they said to taxi to XX via 1. Once back on with the Tower Controller we asked her when the Tower had opened and she said at XA:00 and we mentioned the ASOS stated that they were closed and she said they had forgotten to flip the switch for the ATIS. The cause was the Tower forgetting to flip the switch to broadcast the ATIS when they opened so the ASOS was still broadcasting and it stated the Tower was closed. The Tower needs to make sure they are broadcasting the ATIS when they open.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On approach to 16R in SEA we experienced an intermittent RADALT failure. Weather was VMC; so a go around was not required. I first noticed this failure in the HUD at a RADALT of 390 AGL and approximately 580 MSL. It occurred one more time before touchdown. I am not sure if this is related to the 5G rollout; but though it was important to report. I made a logbook entry for Maintenance as well.
Procedure,At about 5000 ft. near ZZZZZ on approach into ZZZ; after an emergency turn back en route to ZZZ1 for dual EEC failures and Display Source indicating on captain's side PFD; we got a traffic call from ATC. I slowed my descent as the target on my screen was getting closer. At that time ATC canceled our approach clearance and turned us right. Seconds later we got a RA to climb so I climbed about 500 ft. to avoid the traffic; which the PM (Pilot Monitoring) saw visually in our climbing turn. Eventually the passing traffic moved behind us and we were re-issued an approach clearance for the visual approach to [Runway] XXL at ZZZ. We landed uneventfully and taxied safely to the gate; whereupon the flight was cancelled due to the engine EEC failures.
Aircraft,There was a maintenance delay due to the inbound flight reporting high N1 vibrations. The inbound flight reported N1 vibrations reached 1.9 VIB during cruise at FL340. However after descending it was brought back into limits. Maintenance in ZZZ1 conduced an engine run up at takeoff thrust and signed off the aircraft. The flight was uneventful except for a L FADEC FAULT 1 status message that came up twice. That was written up upon landing and MEL'ed. On the [next] flight; during climb; the left engine VIB entered the caution zone reaching 1.8 VIB. The Captain (PF (Pilot Flying)) elected to continue the climb with the left engine just outside of the climb detent and level off at an altitude below our filed altitude of FL370. During climb; ITT was slightly higher on the left engine than the right but well within limits. Oil pressure and temperature were both nominal. The Captain called for the QRH for N1 vibrations which we ran while climbing. The Captain briefed myself that during level off he would reduce thrust more than normal toward idle in hopes of bringing the N1 vibrations back into the normal range. Upon level off at FL330; the Captain reduced thrust as briefed; however the N1 vibrations increased and physical vibrations could be felt in the flight deck and through the flight controls; namely the rudders. Increasing thrust back to the normal cruise range had little effect on VIB although it did start increasing again. By then L ENG VIB was around 2.3. I snapped a picture on my phone of the engine instruments at this time. The decision was made to request a descent from Center in preparation for an intentional engine shutdown following the QRH which said that if vibrations were still occurring to proceed with the intentional engine shutdown QRH checklist. We requested FL250 and began a descending. We had agreed that ZZZ was our best option to divert and the Captain briefed the FAs (Flight Attendants) of the situation and ran through the [checklist] items. Following the Intentional Engine Shutdown checklist we coordinated with ARTCC for an uneventful single engine visual approach and landing. Upon clearing runway we had the fire team inspect the aircraft for any hazards prior to continuing to the gate and deboarding passengers.When we accepted the aircraft from Maintenance we discussed that there was a likelihood of the incident happening again. Maintenance advised us that the engine 'probably needed a fan adjustment soon' but they signed it off so we accepted the aircraft. Maintenance procedures may be inadequate to troubleshoot and sign off an aircraft that has had N1 Vibrations in flight. Especially in this cause where the initial vibrations on the inbound flight happened at FL340.
Human Factors,I was sent to Gate XX to Aircraft X by my Lead so the original pilot can fix his write up on Aircraft X log book. When I got to the gate the aircraft was already push back on the aisle way. I used the ramp headset and spoke to the Pilot. Who I was and why I was there. I ask him if it was ok for me to bring a lift & give him the log book through the window so he can fix his write up. He said ok. I ask him to turn his engine #1 off & he gave me a signal to come through engine #2 to double check I ask him again to turn his engine #1 off. he gave me the signal to come around engine #2 for the second time. I said ok; few minutes later I drove across in the front of the Aircraft X and park the lift on the right side of the aircraft under co pilot window. When I came back the ramp people were gone but the engine #2 was off. Since engine #2 was off I thought me and the Pilot were on] the same page. I park the lift and put the stabilizer down before I can go up the aircraft started rolling but engine #2 was still off. Try to move it but there was nothing I can do so I jumped off the lift. After that the aircraft impacted the lift.I was rushing and didn't follow all the steps. [I should have taken my] time.
Human Factors,Total flight time 9 minutes.Captain (PF (Pilot Flying))CoPilot (PM (Pilot Monitoring))We departed ZZZ1 with an IFR clearance 'cleared to ZZZ; rwy heading; radar vectors ZZZ2; direct. Climb maintain 3000'.' Both ZZZ1 and ZZZ were reporting VFR conditions. We waited approximately 25-30 before we were given cleared for takeoff. I the Captain briefed to the Copilot that this is a short flight (less than 20 Nautical miles away; and that we would keep take off flaps out the entire route so that we can fly slower and set us up for the quick landing into ZZZ. After takeoff we were given a right turn to 360 degrees and contact Departure.  Upon checking into Departure communicated that 'we had a visual of ZZZ; we were given ' cleared for the visual approach Runway XXL into ZZZ. The next controller (Approach) statedController : 'altimeter 30.25; Do you have ZZZ insight' Copilot : unreadable 'yes we were cleared for the visual approach.'Controller : 'YES SIR; You are in a 4000 ft. MVA climb immediately; you are at 1500 ft. in a 4000 ft. MVA; climb immediately; climb and maintain 4000 ft. 'inside the cockpit I verbalized to the Copilot to confirm we got cleared for the visual into XXL into ZZZ!? He confirmed yes! Having conflicting info from 2 Controllers; and with terrain and airport in sight I made the decision to cancel the IFR flight plan. Copilot (not recorded; due to inoperable PTT or blocked by another transmission): announced our intention to cancel IFR.Controller : 'Expedite climb; climb and maintain 4000 ft.!'That's when I (Captain) jumped on the radio and announcedCaptain: 'Aircraft X is canceling IFR we are VMC with airport insight; (and reiterated to Controller that ) we were already cleared for the visual approach XXL into ZZZ.'Controller :  'I understand Aircraft X is canceling IFR at this time'.Captain: YES! Controller : 'cancelation of IFR is received and that we are below 4000 ft. MVA (Minimum Vectoring Altitude) do you have terrain in sight?. Captain  terrain in sight; VMC on the visual XXL; switching to Tower.We switch to ZZZ Tower.Captain : checks inZZZ Tower: are VFR or IFR?Captain: VFR; but explains what had happened with previous Controller.ZZZ Tower: I am familiar with that Controller it doesn't surprise me;......XXL clear to land.Captain: confirms clear to land XXL.ZZZ Tower: You are #1 to land.Copilot: ConfirmsZZZ Tower: You are #1 to landInside the cockpit Captain confirms Copilot is using correct PTT (Push to talk); Copilot confirms and resumes his duties and transmits to Tower...Copilot: #1 clear to land.Aircraft lands.
Environment - Non Weather Related,A crane was set up at Billings Terminal. The NOTAM stated 236 AGL. A snow storm began and visibility / ceilings dropped to IFR and near approach minimums. Aircraft X was inbound for ILS to Runway 28R. We were concerned about the crane and checked missed approach instructions for [the] 28R ILS. I told the Radar Controller to amend Aircraft X missed approach instructions from 4;000 before a left turn; to 4;500 before a left turn.Aircraft X did go missed approach and began a climb straight ahead. I noticed on the radar display that they were drifting left of the runway towards the crane; which was barely visible from the Tower. I gave Aircraft X a vector away from the crane as I was concerned with the proximity. I then saw Aircraft X out the Tower window pass just slightly right of and slightly above the crane. Reviewing Falcon and estimating the crane position put Aircraft X 0.1 mile laterally and 450 ft. above the crane. There were no adjustments to approach minimums; decision heights; or minimum descent altitudes made aware to pilots or ATC.I have been made aware that construction like this and use of a crane in close proximity to a runway alters approach minimums and this should all be NOTAM'd. As far as I can tell none of this was done. The Front Line Manager and Air Traffic Management were made aware of the event and operations continued throughout the day with even worse weather. Although the crane was only about a third of a mile from the Tower and more than double the height of the Tower; it wasn't always visible. ATC was not informed of any changes to approach minimums nor were any alternate missed approach instructions brought up before this event. This should have been all planned and briefed beforehand and possible cancelled due to weather.
Ambiguous,On the RYDRR 2 Arrival approaching CLIFY at approximately 7;500 ft; a drone passed by our right wing at our altitude. It was close enough that we were able to see it in our landing lights. I initially noticed it when I saw what looked like position lights approaching the aircraft. There was no time to react.
,Runway switch to a previously closed runway. Visual approach backed up with the ILS Runway XXR that showed a good identification; but was out of serviceGPWS ; GPWS Terrain ; ATC Issued Low Altitude Warning
Human Factors,While on visual approach to SAT we were given a runway change. We executed the runway change in the FMC and verified the changes.  As the Captain intercepted the localizer we began our approach. As the glide slope started to come in we started our descent. I could start to see that we were visually low on approach and stated that a correction was necessary. He also verified this and began to correct the altitude. The GPWS warning was activated around the time of the correction. We had both the runway and Tower in sight as we corrected. The Tower Controller noticed our altitude and informed us that the 13R ILS was OTS. We landed without further incident.
Ambiguous,Possible 5G interference. Soon after liftoff in IMC we received multiple 'terrain-terrain' warnings. The Captain's Radio Altimeter was on MEL and the FOs Radio altimeter became erratic. The warnings began 200 or 300 feet AGL and continued until about 1200 ft. MSL. The event was reported to ATC (Oakland Center) on XXX.X. The Radio altimeter behaved normally on descent into ZZZ. Maintenance decided to replace the radio altimeter transceiver.
Aircraft,A normal departure from ZZZ took us through a normal level off; switch over to Center Controllers; and a crew change for the first break. I was on the first break; just over an hour after takeoff; the airplane was cruising at 32000 ft. and I felt a pronounced deceleration; it felt from my position on the upper deck as if the airplane was starting a descent. I went up to the flight deck and observed that we had a FLAPS DRIVE EICAS message and an expanded flap position display that showed the cross-hatch 'in transit' depiction for the right wing mid span leading edge device. I switched back into the left seat and while doing this I noticed the red maximum speed indicator on the airspeed had come down to 280 kts. while the red minimum speed indication had come up to about 255 and the roughly 25 kt. window in between was showing the minimum maneuvering speed amber line. The deceleration had been the autothrottle trying to reset the speed below the max speed for flaps 1 but also trying to stay above the min maneuvering speed and this was impossible because they were overlapping. It was close to 280 kts. which gave us a mach number of about .76 (we had been at mach .86 for cost index 600). I asked one crewmember to find a FLAPS DRIVE procedure in the QRH while I disconnected the autothrottles and set the speed bug to 280 at the bottom of the red. I asked the First Officer in the right seat to maintain the position of Pilot Flying and also explained to him he would have to maintain the speed manually. The QRH procedure takes you to a decision point asking whether FLAPS DRIVE appeared during flap retraction; or during flap extension; in our case neither of those cases applied to us so we could not accomplish much in the way of corrective action until reaching the deferred items and the instruction to use a Vref for flaps 30+25. At this point I confirmed with Dispatch and Maintenance Control via a satphone call that a return to ZZZ would be warranted. I initiated a re-clearance back to ZZZ via CPDLC with the Center Controller; which we received as direct ZZZZZ; direct ZZZZZ1 for the ZZZZZ arrival. Once on course back to ZZZ we requested; again through CPDLC; clearance to begin a fuel dump to reduce down to max landing weight; this was eased by the fact this airplane has the MLW option on the fuel jettison selector. We briefed that I would become flying pilot for the final approach and landing; and we had calculated our ref speed of 181 using vref 30+25 guidance from the QRH; and we also determined landing distances from the performance inflight section of the QRH. We had also asked the Dispatcher to do a landing distance calculation to back us up. I determined I wanted to use Runway XXL; the longest runway; and that we would plan a turnoff at the end with autobrakes 3 to prevent creating additional problems of hot brakes after landing at a higher ref speed. The Center Controller had asked us if we were declaring an emergency as did the Center controller when we got into radar contact. In both cases we replied negative. We started configuring flaps early as we had briefed; I had said I expected to get FLAPS PRIMARY and that the flaps would extend slowly. This is exactly what occurred; but as we got to flaps 1 and then flaps 5 we noticed that from the expanded flap display that all the flaps were indicating normally down. We also verified this visually out the window; that the midspan flaps were down on the right side. Further flap extension occurred at the normal speed although FLAPS PRIMARY remained displayed. Once we had the gear down and flaps 20 set; and all groups were in normal down position; I made the decision to use the normal flaps 25 ref speed for a slower landing since we were confident of the flap position. This resulted in a flaps 25 landing without incident; and the opportunity for an earlier turnoff with brake temp values 1 or less. We left the flaps at the 25 position for the taxi in.In this situation the crew workedtogether in excellent fashion; I believe this event can be a great example of good CRM and teamwork.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Possible 5G Radio Altimeter interference event. On Approach to Runway 8 received intermittent RA fault indication on Captains PFD about 3 miles outside of the Final Approach Fix. Complied with QRH procedures and items required in bulletin XX-XXXX. This was in a high task workload situation where we were configuring for landing. Fortunately the weather was VMC and the field was in sight.The QRH requires the pilot to disconnect the auto throttles and stow the HUD. Fortunately we were able to do this; but I can envision a scenario where the weather is worse; the ATC frequency is busy and a crew member does not reference the QRH and just lands. Some training on this scenario seems justified.
Ambiguous,It was a hazy day coming into Roanoke to land on Runway 24. We asked for RNAV 24 and Approach started giving vectors. ATC asked us to descend and maintain 4000 [ft]. We were at 4000 [ft.] on a left base and about 5 miles from HIBAN which is the final approach fix for RNAV 24. ATC asked us to turn left and maintain 4000 [ft.] until establishment and cleared us for RNAV 24. That's when we got a EGPWS warning for terrain 'pull up'. We didn't initiate any descent and were still maintaining ATC assigned 4000 ft. As a crew we followed the procedure for terrain warning and executed a go-around and informed ATC about the terrain warning. ATC replied saying 'recently other people are getting terrain alerts where we got it.' We followed all the procedures and had an uneventful landing on the next attempt to the same runway.Higher altitude for vectors by ATC would be appropriate. Vectoring through a slightly different route avoiding any ridges that could trigger EGPWS.
Ambiguous,After takeoff around 400 ft. AGL till around 900 ft. AGL we got the RA flag [with] no other indications. On arrival into RDU for 5R; again we got RA flag starting around 700 ft. AGL till about 100 ft. on and off. We also got a Tailstrike Avoid Fail message which went away around 100 ft. AGL. Logbook entry was made and ATC was notified.
Ambiguous,Flight Attendants called at cruise altitude and reported feeling light headed; nausea; and a 'bubbling' sensation on their skin. Symptoms mirrored hypoxia and we donned our Crew O2 Masks; [requested priority handling] with ATC for Crew Members feeling ill and descending normally to 10;000 feet. After flying at 10;000 feet for 10-15 minutes; F/As reported Passengers were feeling better and F/A's were improving; but still felt light headed and remained on POB (Portable Oxygen Bottle). EMS was requested to meet aircraft at the gate. Landing in ZZZ was normal; and Crew and Passengers were evaluated by EMS with no one requesting transport. Maintenance was notified of POB usage.
Human Factors,Pushed back without Final DG. Received during pushback.
Aircraft,During climbout after gear retraction; it sounded as if the nose gear was extending again; followed by nose gear retraction. This occurred several times and was accompanied by extremely loud mechanical noises which sounded like the nose gear in motion. We suspected that the uplock was not engaging the nose gear. We leveled off and took delay vectors in order to work the issue. First Officer flew the aircraft while I contacted Maintenance through Dispatch via ARINC and came to the conclusion that it was best to return to ZZZ. A return to ZZZ was worked out with ATC. Priority handling was declared by ZZZ Tower. An uneventful landing followed. After landing we had an indication that the left side forward emergency over wing exit had opened. FO (First Officer) told the passengers to remain seated and the aircraft was stopped in order to query the flight attendants on that situation. We were told that the indication was simply from the handle cover falling off. At this point we continued to the gate.
Aircraft,Left hydraulic quantity EICAS came on after aircraft fully configured for landing on short final. Landed on XXL in ZZZ uneventful. Taxied off runway onto Taxiway 1. Noticed tiller steering was getting degraded. We stopped the airplane on the Taxiway; set brake; shutdown left engine and left electric hydraulic pump. Started APU then shutdown the right engine. Requested a tow to the Gate. Left hydraulic quantity showed 16. Briefed maintenance and Chief Pilot.
Ambiguous,After an uneventful brief; pushback; startup; and taxi; we were cleared for takeoff on Runway 9R; intersection BB; at O'Hare (ORD). I was the pilot flying. The weather was perfect. No clouds; no precipitation; light winds; dry runway; and light takeoff weight (362K pounds). I was well rested and not fatigued at all. After advancing the throttles and handing them off to the Captain; everything was fine. Between 80 and 100 knots; a Red Windshear warning appeared on the ND (Navigation Display) along with an aural Windshear warning. There was NO associated pie-shaped wedge on the display to indicate where the windshear was. There was only a very narrow band about 50 degrees left of the nose from the triangle at the center of the display extending radially outward all the way to the outside of the ND. This band was only a degree or two wide and seemed to be a very clearly erroneous; spurious indication. Given the perfect weather; a windshear indication was completely unexpected and the unusual display caused confusion. Within a second or two; the Captain clearly stated 'I've got it' and initiated rejected takeoff procedures which were uneventful. After clearing the runway and accomplishing all applicable checklists; we contacted Maintenance; who directed us to return to the gate; which we did.
Aircraft,At cruise altitude en route from ZZZ-ZZZ1; we received a HYD B RSVR LO LVL ECAM. I was the PM (pilot Monitoring) and to address the ECAM; I had the FO (First Officer) (PF (Pilot Flying)) take the radios so I could address the ECAM and get in the QRH. Executed the ECAM; and referenced page in the QRH. Based on the landing distance chart; we calculated our landing distance at 3.660 ft; and immediately got both Maintenance and Dispatch in the loop. Dispatch also calculated landing distance and to be conservative; we agreed to use 4;000 ft. A few minutes after accomplishing the QRH; ECAMs complete; screens normal; we then got a L spoiler 3 indicating extended. We notified Dispatch and added the 10% fuel penalty. We landed without incident and upon ZZZ1 Maintenance observation; we were notified that there was hydraulic fluid alongside our entire underbelly; which validates the low level reservoir fluid level for the Blue system.
Human Factors,I was working Aircraft X as an upgrade lead on Gate in ZZZ; and there was a quick pack box in the gate cart; when time to scan it the scanners went out when I tried to load it then the scanners came back on a few minutes to departure and when I scanned the quick pack box it didn't show me specifically that it was a hazmat after the scanner started working; so after the trip went out I was informed to contact load plan; then the Supervisor came in to confirm that it wasn't a hazmat after calling cargo; and cargo told him it wasn't a hazmat; then after the trip left then the Supervisor called load plan afterwards; and they told him it was and that the aircraft had to return to secure the hazmat.
Aircraft,While in flight at level cruise at FL320; I was in the bunk in the rear of the aircraft when I noticed a power reduction. Immediately afterwards; the seat belt sign illuminated and I made my way to the flight deck. There was a FLAPS DRIVE EICAS with an expanded flap display indicating that the right mid-span leading edge flap deployed. As a result the airspeed band became very tight between Mmo and the yellow band as the FMC wanted to honor the maximum flap extension speed. This was in close proximity to our stall speed. The auto throttle was disconnected and the Pilot Flying manually maintained Mach. 75. We consulted with the company via sat-phone and were advised to return to ZZZ. We coordinated with ATC for the return and fuel dump. An uneventful landing was made below MLW.
Aircraft,While cruising at FL350 along Airway X between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 intersections; the Master Caution light illuminated along with the FLT CONT system annunciator light. After saying 'Your Aircraft' to the Captain who was Pilot Flying for this leg and the Captain responding with 'MY AIRCRAFT;' we looked up to the overhead panel and saw the LOW PRESSURE amber light illuminated to the FLT CONTROL B side. I opened the electronic QRH to page X and read the following Condition: 'Hydraulic system pressure to the ailerons. elevators and rudder is low.' After also reading the Objective; we accomplished the only step in the QRH by moving the FLT CONTROL switch on the affected side; after confirmation; to STBY RUD. This action illuminated two other amber lights: YAW DAMPER and FEEL DIFF PRESS. There was no mention in the QRH that these two lights would subsequently light after moving the FLT CONTROL B switch to STBY RUD. After seeing these two additional amber lights; I opened the QRH to review the instructions associated with these 2 amber lights. The FEEL DIFF PRESS QRH step said to continue normal operation but that control column forces may be higher than normal; particularly during the flare. We discussed this as a crew. We then reviewed the YAW DAMPER light QRH steps; followed them and reviewed those instructions as a crew (including not to land with flaps greater than 30 and to avoid moderate or severe turbulence). The YAW DAMPER amber light remained lit after following the QRH steps. After briefly discussing the option to land in ZZZ; the Captain made the decision to return to ZZZ1. I informed ATC of our desire to do a 180 degree turn and return to ZZZ1. The ATC Controller asked why; and I responded; due to a flight control problem. The Controller gave us instructions to turn north and then gave us a clearance to return to ZZZ1. The Controller also asked if we needed further assistance; and I stated not at this time. During the turn back to ZZZ1; it was obvious the YAW DAMPER system was not working as it felt like we would slip and slide through the air in response to every gust of wind. This was even more pronounced on final approach. En route to ZZZ1 we reviewed possible diversion options should we lose hydraulic quantity or pressure but both remained stable; although System A side QTY had reduced to about 80% from 105% at departure. En route; we lowered our altitude to increase fuel burn and reduce fuel on board as much as possible. The APU was also started for that reason. We read the FOM requirements for an overweight landing which clearly state that [priority handling must be requested]. As we checked in with ZZZ1 approach; I [requested priority handling] and our intentions to conduct an overweight landing with a flight control problem in ZZZ1. I asked for Runway XX with no LAHSO (Landing And Hold Short Operations) restriction. The ATC Controller asked for other information like fuel on board in minutes and souls on board. We had XXX souls on board. During final approach the Captain stated the flight controls felt sluggish and I could feel the aircraft slip and slide in the YAW axis. The Captain made a smooth landing at a low vertical rate of descent and we exited the runway and taxied to the gate with no further incident. CFR had been called and they were there along side the runway if needed. Possible blockage in the B side Flight Control Hydraulic lines.No suggestion on how to prevent this; but I would suggest adding additional information to the FLIGHT CONTROL LOW PRESSURE section of the QRH that includes the possibility that the YAW DAMPER and FEEL DIFF PRESS lights could also illuminate and to follow those QRH steps and discuss those flight implications as a crew. The QRH implicitly treats this flight condition as very benign due to the simplicity and lack of info in the QRH for this flight problem. Is a potential blockage in the hydraulic lines to the primary flight controls really a benign condition? A context to the severity or non-severity of this flight condition would be appreciated so that decisions on continuing flight or diverting can be better made.
Aircraft,Flight was supposed to be approximately 2.5 hours from ZZZ-ZZZ1. Immediately after takeoff from ZZZ; I (Pilot Flying) realized the electronic trim for the horizontal stabilizer was not working. It was working prior to takeoff and was used to set the proper stab trim. The First Officer (Pilot Monitoring) tried his yoke trim switches; and they also did not work. We ran the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist; which restored our ability to trim the stabilizer using manual trim. A secondary effect of losing electronic elevator trim is also losing the autopilot. We decided the best course of action was to return to ZZZ. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ for an uneventful landing. Airplane was then turned over to Maintenance for repair.No known causal factors. We had been de-iced prior to takeoff; but there is no reason to believe there was any ice buildup or contact with the deicing equipment since the manual trim worked fine.My opinion is this event was the result of a mechanical malfunction. Sometimes complex machines have malfunctions; so I have no suggestions to prevent a similar event in the future.
Weather,Flight plan release filed ILS ZZZZZ1 for Runway XXR. ATIS at cruise was calling for Runways YYL/R. Loaded and briefed ILS ZZZZZ2 for YYL. ATC clearance passing ZZZ1: pilot's discretion to FL250 ILS ZZZZZ2 for Runway YY. Prior to ZZZZZ3 we were given a heading of 160 for 2 minutes then back to ZZZZZ3. Next ATC clearance was direct ZZZZZ4 descend to 18000. Around ZZZZZ4 frequency change. Next controller gave us direct ZZZZZ5 descend 15000.We had briefed/anticipated this possibility. We requested RNP ZZZZZ6. At this time; there was confusion with ATC with which runway we were going to get assigned. Holding instructions were being given to other aircraft. We briefly talked about the possibility of holding at ZZZZZ5. Airport was in the process of switching the Runways to XXL/R. ATC came to us and assigned YYR. Apparently we would be the last ones in before the switch. Quickly loaded the FMS and briefed the approach. We reconfirmed our approach assignment based on all the transmissions to other aircraft being given XXL. Cleared for the RNP ZZZZZ6. After ZZZZZ5 but prior to ZZZZZ7; ATC gave us a clearance to maintain 190 kts. Passing ZZZZZ7; we asked to slow down to meet the restriction at ZZZZZ8. ATC's response was 'you're cleared for the approach'. Aircraft configuration at this time was gear down; flaps 20 slowing to meet the 'at 185 kts.' at ZZZZZ8. Aircraft is in VNAV PATH descending; speed brakes were being used to help slow. The next sequence of events happen very quickly and are in the best order of memory. While waiting for the airspeed to go below the next flap setting; we received a terrain caution from the GPWS. ATC asks if we are 'on track'; 'do you see the runway?' We break out of some clouds and can visually see terrain. In my quick assessment of the aircraft's descent rate and track; it didn't look like we were going to clear the terrain. Pilot Flying selects ALT HOLD to discontinue approach. We receive another terrain caution. With all of these factors and knowing that we were very close to mountainous terrain; a GO-AROUND was performed as there was some doubt that we may not be on track. We maintained the approach ground track while cleaning up the aircraft. ATC provided vectors to the ILS ZZZZZ 9 and landed. ATC [made a] last minute change of runway. Assigning an airspeed to maintain after clearance for the approach was given and not deleting the airspeed assignment. Approach design could be a factor as the 185 kts. restriction at ZZZZZ8 doesn't allow for configuration to happen in this Heavy Aircraft. (180 kts. for flaps 25/30). High TAS with aircraft descending in VNAV PATH makes it difficult to slow. Having loaded Runway YYR approach in the secondary flight plan could have helped with less FMS workload and more monitoring of the approach.
Human Factors,I operated Aircraft X ZZZ-ZZZ1 on DATE with a suspected fuel leak that resulted in an engine shutdown and diversion to ZZZ2.I was the Pilot Monitoring and the First Officer was the Pilot Flying on this flight. Around the ZZZ3 area the left center tank low pressure lights flickered and I turned the left center pump off with about 400 pounds remaining in the center tank. I didn't see a fuel imbalance between the left and right tanks at this time. Several minutes later the center fuel tank was empty and I turned the right center pump switch off. In addition at this time I didn't notice anything abnormal about the cross feed valve selector or light.At approximately 70 miles SE of ZZZ2; I heard the First Officer say we had a fuel imbalance and looked over to see the fuel IMBAL light illuminated on the right fuel tank. At this point I noted a 1;000 pound fuel imbalance and that in my experience the fuel in the right tank was decreasing at an abnormally fast rate. It had only been around 10 minutes since I turned off the center fuel tanks. At this point the First Officer and myself thought a fuel leak was plausible due to a 1;000 pound fuel imbalance occurring in around 10 minutes and observing an abnormally high rate of fuel decreasing from the right tank. I proceeded to run the fuel leak-engine QRH and contacted the flight attendants to request one of them check for a fuel leak/mist coming from the back of the right (#2) engine. While running the QRH I felt time pressures to stop the fuel imbalance before it led to adverse control issues. At step 5 I recorded the total fuel and time (I don't remember what I recorded) and proceeded to the condition statement in step 6. After reading the condition statements and based on the abnormally high rate of fuel decrease in the right tank I proceeded to step 7. At this point I thought I confirmed an engine fuel leak because we were now at 1;200 pounds imbalance in 10-15 minutes. Far greater than the 500 pounds in less than 30 minutes that the QRH states. By this time the FA reported not seeing any fuel leaking from behind the right (#2) engine. Knowing that we were going to shut down the #2 engine I requested priority handling and requested a lower altitude. In addition we requested vectors to ZZZ2. By the time we shut down the #2 engine we had a 1;400 pound fuel imbalance. I'd like to add that after shutting down the #2 engine the QRH calls for the cross feed selector to be opened. The cross feed valve opened normally with no abnormal indications and closed normally with no abnormal indications several minutes later when we decided to even out the imbalance by burning fuel from the left tank.We completed the QRH; received landing data from dispatch and briefed the FAs and PAX. Finally we were vectored to an ILS XXR in visual conditions. On the ground in ZZZ2 we waited 30-45 minutes for Customs to arrive and spoke to the PAX about the delayed deplaning. I don't have any additional information to add to the ASAP report than what I reported above in the event narrative.While rereading the Fuel leak-engine QRH step 6 after the event; I realize that my decision to proceed to step 7 was based on what I read the step 6 condition statement to say of 'the fuel quantity is decreasing at an abnormal rate out of the right tank'. Rather than basing it on what the condition statement actually said 'or the total fuel quantity is decreasing at an abnormal rate'. This was a mistake.I can say that the fuel imbalance QRH checklist would probably have been more appropriate to call first. However this wasn't an imbalance that took time to develop. We experienced the fuel IMBAL light and an abnormally high rate of fuel decrease from the right tank around 10 minutes after turning the center pumps off. I didn't notice any fuel imbalance prior to turning the center tanks off. I don't think that it was unreasonable to run the fuel leak-engine QRH in these circumstances.
Aircraft,On approach into ZZZ around 5;000 feet MSL; we began selecting flaps. The flaps began to extend but froze at about 0.5 degrees extension.We told ZZZ Approach that we needed to cancel the approach. ZZZ Approach vectored us north on downwind so we could run the appropriate QRH.We determined the correct QRH in this situation to be: Trailing Edge Flap Disagree - The trailing edge flaps are not in the commanded (flap handle) position. There was no asymmetry. We completed the QRH; landed; and taxied to the gate uneventfully.We are awaiting the cause for the flap extension failure from the maintenance investigation. Practicing flap malfunctions in CQ (Continuing Qualification) definitely helped with the flap failure on this flight. Also it's been great practicing early missed approaches in CQ the past 2 years as I got to apply that training on this flight!
Human Factors,On the STAR into ZZZ. Taken off STAR for radar vectors to final. On base leg; field in sight; were cleared for Visual Approach. Selected VNAV; LNAV; and field elevation in the Mode Control Panel the aircraft was high and slow to descend and slow to approach speed. At FAF I notified the First Officer; the trend was high and a MAP was likely going to happen. Just before 1;000 feet AGL configuration gate; still not in final configuration; I called for go-around. Go-around was uneventful and the right call. On setup for Final Approach FIX. Flying the MAX; it is slick and takes longer to slow and descend. We were left high before [the] next fix on approach and could have used Vertical Speed to expedite descent then selected LNAV/VNAV. While we could have continued and attempted to make [the] configuration gate; I felt it was best to discontinue approach and go-around. Go-around was uneventful.Be prepared for being left high on STAR and be ready to expedite descent to continue approach. Remember when flying [the] MAX it does not slow and descend as quick as [the 737] NG.
Aircraft,After takeoff while in the climb about 4;000 feet to level off at 5;000 feet which was our clearance altitude with auto pilot off we got a EICAS message stab trim unscheduled. There was no change felt in the flight controls and a check of the trim tab show no signs of moving or movement. I called for the QRH and asked the First Officer to engage the autopilot. We leveled off at 5;000 feet and proceeded with the QRH. ATC cleared us to climb to 15;000 feet at which time we notified ATC that we would like to remain at 5;000 feet while we work on an issue and complete a check list. After completing the QRH; autopilot center and right would not engage. We elected to return to our departure airport. We notified ATC and got radar vectors to the airport for an ILS approach and landing without incident. We went back to the ramp and after finally getting a parking spot; the item was entered in the airplane log book.This failure was cause by flight control computer failure; which may be a result of the airplane sitting in extreme cold weather for a few days.I'm not sure of what could have prevented this failure as the cold weather is unavoidable. Maybe not having the airplane sitting in extreme cold weather could have help.
Aircraft,After takeoff; before 10;000 feet; I began hearing a loud knocking and grinding noise every few seconds. I thought it was strange and wondered what it was. Shortly after; the flight deck called and asked if I heard it and where I suspected the sound was coming from. He said they thought it was a problem with the nose gear; that we were turning back to ZZZ and did not know if we would be able to get the landing gear down; so to prepare for that and that he would let us know. I called the back and told them to begin going over their commands; etc.; we made the necessary announcements. The Captain also gave an announcement. I chatted with the flight deck again; once or twice; about the sound; how I was doing; if the cabin was ready. I told him I was hoping for the best; but preparing for the worst. We heard the landing gear come down only it was louder; longer; and different than the normal sound. At this point; I assumed we would be in an emergency landing/evacuation situation. Then the flight deck called and said the panels all indicated there were no issues and that he was anticipating a normal landing. I relayed the info to the back; we did a quick cabin check for seat belts; and strapped in; still a bit uncertain what would happen. Just before touchdown; maybe 3 minutes to landing; the Captain called and asked if we were ready. I replied that we were ready. We landed safely and breathed a sigh of relief. We were taxiing slowly; we could see fire trucks (presumably to meet us if it went bad) and all of a sudden heard the computer giving the command 'remain seated.' We all began shouting our commands to remain seated. I was going over the next steps - release seat belts; how I would pull the large handle (not the small; that I am so used to pulling to disarm) and what the evacuation would look like. I reminded myself where the megaphone was and how; once every one was off; I would check the cabin. I decided in my mind who I would have help at the bottom as there was a family traveling in first with their 3 small children. So I decided the dad would not be a good ABA (Able Bodied Assistant) because he would want help his children.All this happened very fast. The passengers were unsettled and a little panicky from the commands being shouted. There was a lot of confusion. Then the phone rang and the flight deck said the alarm was going off; indicating an over the wing exit had been opened. Was it open; was someone trying to leave the plane? I did not know; said I would call him back. I ran down the aisle and arrived to see the exit panel off the window. I asked the passenger closest if she had taken that off. She said it had fallen. I ran back to the phone and let the flight deck know. I asked them if we would be going to the gate; which gate if so; or air stairs? Then I walked through the cabin telling people that everything was fine; there was a false alarm that the window exit was open; but all is OK and we would be at the gate shortly. The Captain then made an announcement and I went to my jump seat; then also made an announcement about taxiing; staying in their seat; keeping seat belts fastened; etc. we arrived safely; albeit very shaken up.
Procedure,Found L-3 door knurled nut safetied but fork not engaged (see pic). During initial review; Job Card XXXXXXXXXXX was accomplished in ZZZ on DATE.
Human Factors,At XA:00 on Date; I pushed the Aircraft X out of the hangar to the pad for an engine run following a borescope inspection. After I pushed the aircraft; [I] disconnected the tug. The air stairs were pushed to the aircraft for the second mechanic to occupy the right seat for the engine run. At this time I was the ground man responsible for making sure that no one or thing walked in front of or behind the aircraft engines. The flag man was in position prior to engine start . At this time the person running the aircraft asked for start on the number 2 engine. I signaled him that the area was clear of personnel and equipment and to start number 2. Just after the engine lit off I observed sparks and heard noises coming from [the] number 2 engine. I signaled to the run man very animated to shut down. He did not immediately shut down and I again signaled to shut down. As the engine was winding down I observed parts of a radio on the ground and in the engine inlet. Also we found parts of the radio on the ground behind the engine. Some smaller parts were stuck to the engine blades.The event occurred because one of the individuals left his radio in the inlet after calling Quality Control to do the borescope inspection of the engine. This individual also was the one running the engine and did not do his walk around of the aircraft and clear the engines prior to running the aircraft engine.My suggestion is that we have a checklist that is required to be checked off and signed for at each run event prior to engine start that is signed and placed in the work package.
Ambiguous,Aircraft X on takeoff BWI Runway 15L; after gear and flaps raised the TAWS (Terrain Awareness Warning System) began issuing erroneous terrain warnings. Tower gave a vector right turn to 330 degrees to level off at 4;000 [feet]. With the terrain warnings and autopilot not engaging; the pilot flying was trending to miss the level off and rollout on heading. Captain took the aircraft and leveled off at approx 4;500 ft and a 360 heading. While correcting to assigned heading and altitude; crew missed the frequency change to Departure and transmitted on Tower. Crew corrected to originally issued heading and altitude; switched to departure frequency and continued without incident.
Aircraft,Plane had an air return the day before for nose gear noise on takeoff. We briefed and anticipated an issue. Normal takeoff just prior to 4000 ft. initial level off a thumping sound started followed later by a LGICU (Landing Gear Control Interface Unit) 2 FAIL ECAM. We leveled at 10;000 ft. and coordinated with Maintenance and Dispatch who all agreed we needed to return to ZZZ. We had burned below Max landing weight while coordinating so we returned for a normal landing. Tower did decide to [assign priority handling] for us. Upon landing we had an over wing exit show open. That turned out to be just the cover came off (another repeat from the day prior). PA to remain seated and coordinated with Flight Attendants that the exit was closed. Taxied to the Gate and swapped planes to go to ZZZ1.
Ambiguous,Applied thrust to exit deice pad at ZZZ. Upon initiating turn onto Taxiway XX lost directional control and the left main slid off the prepared surface of the taxiway. Set the parking brake and made an announcement to the passengers that the aircraft was stuck and to remain seated until we could get towed out. Had the First Officer call Ground and inform them of our location and situation and to call Operations to inform them also of our situation. Started the APU and shut down the engines and informed the flight attendants that it could be a while. Operations showed up with a tug and towed us back to [the] gate where the passengers deplaned. Consulted with Maintenance and they wrote up an inspection of gear and aircraft no damage was found and aircraft cleared for service.
Aircraft,At cruise; (approx 1 hour from landing) ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) F/CTL ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer) PITCH FAULT 2. Shortly followed by F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1. INOP systems - Autopilot 1 and 2; Alternate law - loss of protections - Cat 2 - ELAC Pitch. Ran all ECAMS; checklists; QRH; supplemental QRH. No reset option. [Requested priority handling] out of abundance of caution. Requested priority from ATC for descent and approach - long final on long runway. Advised Dispatch; flight attendants; and passengers. Landed on long runway per procedures (direct law - flaps 3) Landing uneventful - taxied to gate. ATC was very cooperative. Notified Dispatch in the air and after gate arrival.Aircraft had previous write ups for same/similar issue. Aircraft had been in ZZZ for 48 hours prior to this flight for same write up. (ECAM F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1 and 2) and there was a previous write up for ECAM F/CTL ELAC PITCH TRIM FAULT 2.
Ambiguous,Due to performance limitations for Runway 08 in BUR; ATC provided us vectors to Runway 33. With the field in sight; we conducted a visual approach to Runway 33. While visual to Runway 33; our EGWPS (Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System) alerted 'Caution Terrain'; we conducted a missed approach; and ATC vectored us back to Runway 33. The second approach continued until landing.Due to rain prior to arrival; wet runway performance became limited; having a quarterly tailwind also added to limited performance. We had over 12;000 lbs of ferry fuel added to our flight plan that also hindered our landing performance limitations. Pilot Input:Accurate field conditions report from tower; ATIS; prior landing traffic (PIREP). This would have been helpful; as Runway 33 was dry; and we could have landed on Runway 08 if it was listed as Dry. Also; adding ferry fuel to the amount needed to provide options to land on the 'preferred' runway i.e.; if we had 4000 lbs less ferry fuel; we could have landed on Runway 08.
Aircraft,During the FCF (Functional Check Flight) engine relight profile with #1 engine shutdown; the alternate gear and LGTU (Landing Gear Transfer Unit) checks were successfully completed on descent phase of the profile and #1 engine windmill relight was attempted passing 23;500 feet and 305 KIAS approximately 45 NM Northeast of ZZZ. The blue Engine Valve light on the fuel panel remained illuminated when the #1 engine start lever was placed to run with no Fuel Flow. EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) rise or indication of relight. The FCF profile was terminated. QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) procedures (Engine In-Flight Start via Cross bleed) [were] accomplished followed with requesting priority handling as we turned back towards ZZZ. The #1 engine did restart with a cross bleed attempt and QRH procedures [were] completed followed with the QRH precautionary One Engine Inoperative Landing checklist & Non-routine; landing assessment calculation. The descent checklist and pre-landing checklist completed on descent. An uneventful flaps 15 approach and landing conducted to Runway 18L followed with a normal taxi to the Company Maintenance and Engineering ramp. Debriefed with Maintenance. For the [flight] I conducted a few days later; maintenance advised the HMU (Hydro Mechanical Unit); EEC (Electronic Engine Control) alternator and EEC was replaced and normal FCF windmill restart of #1 was successfully accomplished. The rest of the FCF profile for the aircraft Main Base Visit Heavy Check was completed.Faulty engine component; either HMU (Hydro Mechanical Unit); EEC and EEC alternator as all three replaced at once. No added suggestions as the pilot group trains to a wide range of contingencies; mitigates risk and prepared to terminate the profile while complying with QRH and normal procedures.
Procedure,"Climb out passing 9500 ft.; got cabin altitude alert. Aircraft wouldn't pressurize. We leveled off; determined need to return to ZZZ. We requested vectors to dump area and dumped fuel to get to max landing weight. [We requested priority handling] and flew ILS XXL. Taxied back to park.Fatigue. Slept first six hours of 30-hour layover. Attempted to sleep 6 hours prior to alert; was unable to sleep. Release had listed a MEL for Main Cargo Loading."" Upon pushback we got EICAS for ""MAIN CARGO DOOR."" My fatigue combined with expectation bias led me to direct the FO (First Officer) to override the message - override the checklist. The load crew did not fully close the Main Cargo Door. Maintenance reported ""all doors closed and locked"" prior to push. We started the left engine; taxied to XXL and started the right engine abeam the terminal. After the initial EICAS; we received no other alerts until the cabin altitude alert.I should have pulled the crew together and reviewed the messages. The load team should have properly closed the door. Maintenance should not have reported ""doors closed and locked"" when they were not. It seems odd that the takeoff configuration check doesn't incorporate doors; maybe it should. I should have been better aware of my degraded state due to fatigue."""
Aircraft,EECs (Electronic Engine Controls) deferred with no autothrottles allowed with this P&W aircraft. On departure; high/gusty/turbulent winds; FD (Flight Director) was unable to keep up. Erroneous FD & MCP (Mode Control Panel) function; see log book write up. De-automated most of flight. On arrival ZZZZ was using Runway XX special airport approval due to high winds and turbulence. I had numerous altitude excursions +/- required 300 feet. Vectored for approach; hand flying and assigned ILS intercept altitude of 3;000 feet in flaps 5 at 190 kts was unable due to updrafts to make aircraft descend below 3;500 feet; affected descent at GP (General Procedures) intercept by disregarding noise profile and configuring. Went around first approach for hard wind shear warning; numerous aircraft after us as well. Landed 2nd attempt; ATIS reporting winds from 260 with 56 knot gusts; moderate/severe turbulence. After block in; ground crews were unable to open cargo door due to winds; and we timed out. Kudos to all my co workers; cockpit & ground; for their support.
Ambiguous,Airline 1 was in process of pushback from gate and was cleared to push. Airline 2 Aircraft Y was taxiing on taxiway north to south when the Airline1 plane was forced to stop abruptly.
Aircraft,On takeoff roll the Captain (Pilot Monitoring) called 80 kts. Shortly after that he stated something was wrong and we had an IAS Disagree light. About that time we got a Master Caution light with the Engine light illuminated on the six pack. I quickly scanned the engines and they were good. I then looked at my airspeed and we were past VR and quickly eating up runway. I said Rotate? When I didn't hear anything; and saw how much runway was left; I rotated. The aircraft felt like it was accelerating and I felt comfortable rotating.Once airborne we quickly determined my airspeed was correct (crosschecked standby and ground speed). The Captain's airspeed was initially 20-30 below mine; once airborne it was 5-10 below. The Master Caution light went out sometime on climb out. We cleaned up the aircraft and leveled off at 5;000 feet to run checklists. While running the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist the Master Cation and Engine lights came on again; we scanned the engines and the overhead panel and could not find what was causing the lights. They went out after about 20 seconds.We landed uneventfully back at ZZZ. [The First Officer's response and question] is what caused the Master Caution and Engine lights during this event. Nowhere in the Quick Reference Handbook does it say this could be an indication associated with the airspeed disagree. It was extremely distracting during an already stressful event. I suspect one of the Electronic Engine Control's went into the ALT mode causing it. In any event; the Quick Reference Handbook should add this as a possible indication associated with an IAS disagree.
,During a normal takeoff and climb from Runway XX at the ZZZ; we saw a single engine aircraft at our altitude turning away from us. At approximately the same time we heard the Tower Controller tell the single engine aircraft to turn crosswind now. The single engine aircraft was at our altitude and very near to us. We did not have any time to react as we did not see the single engine aircraft until it was wing high turning away from us. Apparently; the single engine aircraft was supposed to do a full stop landing on Runway XYR and either did a touch and go; or a go-around from that Runway. I only first saw the single engine aircraft about when I was retracting the landing gear; and that's when I also heard the First Officer comment on the aircraft.The horizontal distance was likely much less than 1000 feet; possibly even 500 feet. Had the single engine aircraft not reacted; a collision could have occurred at the Runway XX intersection with the Runway XYR extended center line. The single engine aircraft turned away between us departing XX and the Control Tower; for further geographic reference. Tower frequencies may have been split at that time as I heard the Tower Controller; but not the single engine aircraft on frequency. It's also possible that I just may have missed the single engine aircraft transmission. From our vantage point on Runway XX; our visibility of Runway XYR is not good as structures and aircraft block it from our view. Controller staffing limitations may have been a factor here too. Captain Response; Controller staffing needs improvement.
Aircraft,Approximately 50 SSE of ZZZ1; FL340; we observed an Oil Filter Bypass caution light on the #2 engine. I elected to let the FO (First Officer) keep flying while I got out and read the QRH. The caution light was unusual in that it flashed as expected; then behaved erratically. It would momentarily come on and stay on; then flash; then go out; and then flash again. We discussed that it could be an indication problem since all other engine instruments read normally; but since we had the light we would run the checklist. The FO slowly retarded the #2 thrust lever; and when it reached idle; the light went out. I requested a lower altitude from ATC; they cleared us to FL240; and the FO brought up the engine out Cruise page; which indicated a max single engine cruising altitude of FL246. The FO started a -1000 VVI descent using Vertical Speed. We quickly both agreed that we should continue to ZZZ to land and anticipated a gradual descent all the way there. About that point one or two minutes had passed; the Oil Filter Bypass light came on again and stayed on. Before shutting down the engine as directed by the QRH; I called the FAs (Flight Attendants) and told them we were going to shut down the #2 engine; not to be alarmed; to follow normal procedures in securing the cabin; that we were going to land at ZZZ and taxi to the gate to deplane; and that I would make a PA to the Passengers.We continued running the checklist. I was surprised how much adrenaline I felt in my body; and knew I was in the Yellow thinking about what was being done and looking ahead at what had to be done and the various considerations in accomplishing all this. I commend the FO in helping maintain excellent CRM as he asked me to slow down the reading of the checklist so he could keep up and not rush things; and helped ensure we used proper response-response methodology and proper guarding of all switches. After starting the APU; I was impatient in waiting for it to come online and read ahead to see the next steps. We started balancing the fuel; put the transponder in TA; and verified the isolation valve switch in auto. By that time I'd forgotten about the APU start sequence; and it wasn't until later in the descent as we crosschecked everything that I'd forgotten to connect the APU to the #2 side. When discovered; I reached up and connected the APU to #1 and #2. When the autopilot disconnected; I once again realized I was rushing a bit. The FO politely reminded me to not rush. We reconnected the #1 generator; and everything else looked accomplished properly.I [requested priority handling] with ATC and told them we planned to land at ZZZ and taxi to the gate. I gave TRACON the requested information. I sent a message to Dispatch informing them of the situation and our plan to land in ZZZ. They acknowledged.I then made a PA to the Passengers. Later; when debriefing the FAs; they appreciated the heads up call which made them a bit flustered due to never experiencing an engine shutdown before; but also gave them a clear understanding of the plan. They debriefed that I sounded extremely relaxed on the PA (which I'm glad for since I wasn't feeling relaxed); and that all the Passengers were very calm. There were no Passenger concerns noted throughout the event.After the PA I discussed with the FO everything we had done (I believe this is when we noticed the APU error); quickly reviewed everything and asked if there was anything we'd missed. We couldn't think of any. I ran the one engine inoperative landing checklist through the Approach Checklist. The FO verified brake cooling did not require any special procedures. I then took control of the aircraft for the final descent; approach; and landing.It was a nice VFR day with gusty winds. We were cleared the Visual to XXL. I'm grateful for our simulator training. Flying a single engine approach in the SIM is harder than the approach I flew. The MAX -800 is a stable; smooth aircraft. And; although it felt odd flyinga single engine flap 15 visual approach; the aircraft flew nicely and handled it well. We landed and taxied uneventfully to the gate.We debriefed Maintenance on the event and put it in the logbook. I then had many phone calls with [company representatives]; debriefing them of the events. It was concluded the safest course of action was to pull us from the trip and send us home. I agreed with that decision. I've had plenty of adrenaline flying moments (low visibility crosswind landing in spring blizzard); but the adrenaline always dissipated after 30-45 [minutes]. I was surprised how stressed my body felt. It wasn't until I was driving home over four hours later that I started relaxing. That was a first for me.I want to say; again; how well the FO did flying the aircraft and reinforcing excellent CRM as we worked our way through this event. Except for my mistake with rushing the checklist and jumping ahead with the APU; I think we worked very well together bringing this flight to a successful conclusion. I commend the professionalism of ATC; [airport] personnel; ZZZ Station Personnel; Operations Personnel; and (Union). Everything they did was appreciated.
Aircraft,Just after my First Officer briefed the RAVNN 6 Arrival into Baltimore; Washington Center cleared us to descend via the arrival. We were level at flight 28;000 ft.; and ready to go down in a few miles. Suddenly the flight computer said we were 2000 ft. high. Then in a couple seconds later; it said we were too low. Then it said we were right on path. My First Officer started to investigate the problem when Washington Center said again 'Descend on the RAVVN 6' again. But by that time we were too high to make our crossing restriction at FZEEK and then WHHTE. The Controller inquired what was going on; all I could tell him was the flight computer was failing to descend on the arrival. ATC said just to 'make WALKN at 17;000 ft..' We manually started our descent down to 17;000 ft. and made the crossing restriction. We recruised the flight computer at that altitude and it descended perfectly on the rest of the arrival. The remainder of the flight was uneventful. Also; there was no conflict with any other aircraft on the arrival. Monitor; monitor and monitor. You never know when the flight computer is lost it ability to know where it is exactly. You also have to be quick in recovery or you will find yourself high on your arrivals. Always double check your cruise altitude in the flight computer and monitor once again.
Human Factors,"We were on an IFR flight plan and had been handed off for the visual approach to the non-towered airport (ZZZ). We were #1 to the field with 3 jets to follow us. We were listening/ talking to both CTAF and Center as we maneuvered upwind/overhead the runway; at pattern altitude; to make right traffic for Runway XX; as we entered the right base for Runway XX I relayed our 'cancel IFR' through the airplane behind us; as we continued the turn to final; I made my last call of 'short final and that is when we got the first traffic return on our TCAS; we had not observed another unknown traffic up to this point; followed rapidly by it turning yellow and advising 'TRAFFIC TRAFFIC' I quickly scanned left and saw the Aircraft X turning in on top of us; we had 700 ft. separation at this point; he got to within 500 ft. by the time he had past above; us and clear. We never heard him on center frequency or on the local CTAF (XXX.X) and in fact never heard or got a response from him until after he landed and called taxiing in; not clear of the runway. This occurrence could have been completely avoided if the pilot of Aircraft X had used standard pilotage. He did not communicate with anyone in the area and he did not use the standard entry for the pattern; which all airplanes were using; and was just carelessly making his way through the sky. When we departed we observed him leave VFR; no clearance; out through the valley and once again; talking to nobody. While what he did was legal; it was highly careless for the busy; tight; mountainous airport! He choose to operate VFR so that he could be more expeditious and cut in front of everyone. His lack of patience and procedure almost ended in tragedy!"""
Aircraft,"Immediately after touchdown in ZZZ we received the EICAS warning of BAGG SMOKE."" We exited the runway; stopped the aircraft; and requested the Flight Attendant look into the baggage compartment for evidence of a fire. We did this first since we suspected an electrical issue primarily; since the EICAS had failed briefly on approach. As she was looking; we let ATC know; requested fire trucks; and requested priority handling. The Flight Attendant called us back and was unable to confirm nor deny the existence of a fire. We then ran the associated QRH checklist. This included us using the baggage compartment fire extinguishing equipment.The fire department arrived on scene. They went inside the baggage compartment and removed a bag that they said appeared to be smoking. After their inspection of the bag; they concluded it was not smoking. They suggested that propellant from the baggage fire suppression system gave the illusion that this bag was smoking. The bag was placed back onto the aircraft. We then taxied to the gate and unloaded our passengers. After the passengers exited the aircraft and Maintenance came aboard; we began to smell something burning. The aircraft was immediately shut down and turned over to Maintenance.Improvements should be made in the training of ramp personnel. They went into the baggage compartment and began to remove bags while it was full of Halon. Our checklist should indicate that we expressly prohibit ramp personnel from entering the baggage compartment after using the extinguisher instead of just notifying them that is has been used.The burning smell at the gate and brief EICAS failure on approach indicated to us that there was an electrical issue on the aircraft that caused this situation and not a fire of a passenger's baggage."""
Environment - Non Weather Related,Enroute at cruise altitude. We were in smooth air; VMC; and ATC had no reports of clear air turbulence. I believe we were at 290 knots and FL230. Captain had turned off seat belt sign and made required announcement to keep seat belt on when seated. With no traffic notification from ATC; or close traffic on TCAS; we received several seconds or less of wake turbulence. The right wing dipped slightly and it was what I would label as moderate turbulence. There was no indication from the cabin crew that there was any injury. We elected to stay at that flight level.
Aircraft,While descending through about 9;000 ft.; both pilots experienced a very strong magic marker / chemical / fume smell in the flight deck while the Flight Attendents (FA) in the forward cabin smelled a musty / dirty sock / fumes event smell. The FA's in the back did not experience an odor. It came on quickly and quite strong. We donned oxygen and quickly performed the odor recognition and isolation procedure from the manual. Turning Pack 1 off seemed to correct the problem. All necessary logbook entries were made. All necessary reports filed.
Aircraft,"Passing 9;000 ft. on descent into ZZZZ; we received a LH/RH brake fault; followed by LH/RH brake fail. We climbed back to 10;000 ft. to run the QRH. The QRH advised us that no brakes will be available. Unsure if landing in ZZZZ would be an option with Company; we held as close to ZZZ Center as possible. We ACARSed Dispatch and went through our options. Name; our Dispatcher; talked to Maintenance and advised to continue to our destination. The runway was 11;000 ft.; running the landing numbers; we came up just shy of [the] 8;000 ft. needed to land safety.I advised the inflight crew members of the situation; and told them we were in a code yellow. Made a PA to the customers; informing them that there was a possibility of partial brake loss; but that the runway in ZZZZ was more than adequate to land safety. [We requested priority handling and] proceeded on the approach for Runway XX. Upon landing; no brakes were available. I used full reverse to a stop - a normal landing except for the additional runway length. I set the parking brake; and asked inflight to remain seated; remain seated."" I called them to make sure they and the customers were ok; everyone was fine. I then made a PA and informed the customers that since we had no brakes; a tow to the gate was necessary. Once at the gate; passengers deplaned and Maintenance started working on the issue."""
Human Factors,We flew the plane into ZZZ and noticed the pressurization was acting up as I felt it in my ears. Once on ground we received a PRESS AUTO FAULT message. Was doing IOE and had my OE complete the GRG (Ground Reset Guide) and fill out the can. The message cleared and didn't think much more about it. All boarded up and told the Flight Attendant to shut MCD (Main Cabin Door) and once the door was shut the plane pressurized. Cabin alt went to -500 ft. Had a 1;000 ft. climb rate and differential pressure was 0.3 psi. Max is .2. I called Maintenance and received some push back from the person I was talking too. I referenced the max .2 psi and his response was that's on take off and landing. With proper aircraft knowledge the plane should not pressurize with just the APU on in the auto mode. I said its not right and he responded yet again and then I finally said just send out Maintenance. Maintenance came out and immediately said its not correct as I took a video of the issue. They wanted to see it themselves so we removed the passengers and was able to duplicate the issue. The more times we duplicated the issue it got worse. After a power reset and some trouble shooting they couldn't fix it. Of the numerous times not once did a EICAS message appear. Had a plane swap and had an issue with it and had to call the Job Card Supplement about something that I can't remember and he asked me about the pressure issue on Aircraft X. Didn't think much about it but once in ZZZ1 I received an email from Job Card Supplement and it stated that Maintenance found a big piece of insulation stuffed in the out flow valve.Maintenance needs to stop being so quick to say nothing is wrong or having a quick MEL. I could have seen this as in issue as I refused to go with the issue and another Captain could have went with the push back I received from Maintenance. They act like they are personally themselves are paying for Maintenance to come out to the plane. They are worried about delays in my opinion instead of addressing the issue.
Environment - Non Weather Related,DEN ILS35L IFR; contaminated runway; braking action reported good. We were number two and (if I recall correctly) assigned 170 kts. to DYMON. At 500 ft. the preceding aircraft was still on the runway. I advised the FO (First Officer) to be ready for a GA (go around); as ATC queried them to expedite exiting. Approaching threshold they were cleared; at 50 ft.; we got his wake and the aircraft veered to the right. I added power; maneuvered back to the center line. As I was thinking of initiating a go-around we were out of it. Under the circumstances; I made a split decision to continue the landing and land. We touched down extremely soft; to the point that it was difficult to recognize; which might have caused me to hold off the nose a bit longer than usual. At this time the RCAS system activated- LONG LANDING LONG LANDING. It was the first time I had heard it and startled us both. I braked; exited runway; taxied to the gate uneventfully. Afterwards we discovered that the preceding aircraft was a B757.
Human Factors,Departure deviation following heavy Widebody after takeoff.[Runway] 8R cleared for takeoff behind heavy Widebody aircraft.Weather conditions after takeoff; night VFR winds out of southeast 45 knots at 1400 ft. MSL.From rotation to about 4;500 ft. in and out of wake turbulence from preceding heavy Wide body aircraft. Just climbing through 1;000 feet FO (First Officer) stated 'we've dumped our departure route' out of the box/FMC.  [We responded by] putting in JAMBA; first waypoint on SID; back in box and then KBOLA for now. We began our turn direct JAMBA.MIA Departure Control; very busy; asked 'are you proceeding direct JAMBA?'FO responded; 'yes we are now proceeding direct JAMBA; we've been deviating a little to get out of wake turbulence from heavy aircraft we are following.'Departure Control cleared us continue climb 7;000 ft. speed restriction 250 kts.Just before reaching JAMBA Departure Control cleared us direct to KBOLA.4 NM before KBOLA Departure Control gave us a heading and 250 speed restriction still in effect; after which the remainder of the flight continued uneventfully.[We discussed; as a crew;] how and when we; the FO and me; dumped the SID out of the FMC. At the gate; before push back; with due diligence downloaded our route; departure Runway 8R; SID-KMIA FOLZZ1 FOLZZ; and ATC route clearance amendments FOLZZ DIR ZFP DIR BAAGR DIR GRATX then as filed; manually into the FMC. We then reviewed route and points individually as per normal procedures; all good. On the ATC clearance uplink the amended points came up as FOLZZ-N2617.3W07920.9; ZFP-N2633.3W07841.8; BAAGR-N2649.0W07631.3. When input manually to the FMC for example ZFP you get two choices of Lat Long's to choose from; so you pick the one with the corresponding Lat Long's....etc.                                                                 However; it was noted later at the gate that we could have just auto uploaded the ATC amended part of the clearance through the FMC ATC clearance LOAD button which would have put in the ZFP and BAAGR points with the correct Lat Long's less chance of error....'See-Check it out!' I obviously must have pushed that button. No excuse; as I've read many reports from other professional pilots-colleagues on our team sharing similar events. I respect and thank them for sharing so I wouldn't make this mistake. Some of our pilots; new to aircraft and/or don't fly much; great to review things but; there is the right time and place. My timing was bad to review any FMC operations. I should have checked to see; after my FMC review with the FO; that I hadn't messed up our original route data.
Human Factors,New Hire Student First Officer on initial operating experience has bounced landing due to lack of feel of aircraft approaching ground during the landing phase of flight. On go-around; the student applied max thrust and relaxed back stick pressure causing the aircraft to point at the ground requiring Instructor to take controls to avoid ground impact and execute go-around procedure. Student inability to identify aircraft closure rate with ground to start aircraft flare on time; resulting in bounced landing. Instructor Response; have a training event that focuses specifically on balked landings and go-around during simulator training for First Officers prior to releasing students to the line for initial operating experience. Implement a policy for initial operating experience students to return to simulator for specific landing practice if not on track to complete initial operating experience by the 50 hour point due to deficiencies in landing the aircraft.
Aircraft,After taking off from ZZZ I selected gear up on the landing gear lever. Almost immediately we got a GEAR DISAGREE RED MSG. I acknowledged the warning and reminded the First Officer to continue the departure profile. Several seconds later a HYD 3 LO PRESS message. Shortly after that we received a IB GND SPOILER message as well. We told Departure we needed to level and get vectors for a malfunction and to run a checklist. I designated the First Officer to continue being the PF (Pilot Flying). After discussing the problem we both agreed that the most appropriate checklist would be for the hydraulic pressure problem. This was verified on the hydraulic synoptic with 0 pressure and quantity in system 3 and only systems powered by that system having any messages.As I completed the QRH it became evident this would be a diversion. We told Dispatch; and briefed the flight attendants and passengers. I chose to go to ZZZ1. Queried ATC for NOTAMs and longest runway.After briefing the diversion and making sure we had not missed anything I then assumed PF duties for the flaps 20 landing. We landed without further incident.The weather was gusty. However ZZZ1 was the best option considering runway length and orientation with the wind. Wind was 220 @ 18 [kts.] gust 28 [kts.] on final. I decided to have the passengers and flight attendants brace due to the reduced directional control; potentially reduced braking and reducing ground lift dumping. I initiated the brace at approx 500ft. We slowed and decelerated relatively normally and were able to clear the runway with fire trucks surrounding us. I then asked on the PA for everyone to remain seated. Fire and rescue chocked the wheels and reported the left wheel well was covered in hydraulic fluid residue but no fire danger.After letting the passengers and flight attendants know we then were towed to gate by operations.A hydraulic fitting for the left main gear down lock actuator came apart. When the line pressurized upon selecting gear up; the fitting failed and all of our fluid in system 3 was promptly pumped overboard.
Chart Or Publication,3;000 feet cleared approach ILS 24R. Set FAF/GS (glideslope) altitude and initiated descent.  Approaching level and prior to GS capture; ATC called and asked us to confirm altitude and altimeter and on GS.  Responded with information and leveling at GS intercept altitude; below GS. Rest of approach landing uneventful. Spoke to Approach Control Supervisor following event. He wanted to explain that specifically for that approach in VMC there is a VFR corridor below the approach course; and that while today wasn't a big deal due to IMC conditions; it could create a safety conflict. The OMEKI approach fix does not appear in the MCDU (Multi Function Control Display Unit) with ILS 24R selected. Consider including OMEKI as part of database for ILS24R.
Human Factors,We were cleared for the Stadium Visual for runway 29 in EWR.  We had the approach briefed and set up in the FMC.  We were cleared for the approach and headed direct to GIMEE at 3000.  As we crossed GIMEE at 180 kts we set the altitude to touchdown zone elevation and I called for gear down and flaps 15.  We were descending and I called for flaps 25 and then flaps 30 before landing check.  As I watched the descent; we were clearly not on the descent profile and were getting low.  At that point I knew we were below profile [and] we got a 'too low flaps' warning. I disconnected the autopilot; added thrust and stopped the descent.  Simultaneously we got an altitude alert from EWR Tower.  As we turned final we had been pushed slightly off the center line with the strong winds from the northwest; but we were able to line up on the extended center line as the glide path came back to normal.  The approach from there was stable and the landing was on profile.
Aircraft,"I was the Captain on flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. We were dispatched with a deferred pressurization CAC-L1 due to a left air conditioning pack and CAC-L1 failure on the inbound flight. Preflight; taxi; take-off; climb all normal. Shortly after reaching cruise at FL350 we heard the left pack shutdown and received an Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System message of 'Pack L indicating the left pack failed. We completed the appropriate checklist and the pack remained 'failed'. We are now in single pack/pressurization with a XA:05 flight over the North Atlantic; Europe to ZZZ2. We called for the two relief pilots to return to the flight deck to assist in the divert and additional work load. We contacted with Company Dispatcher and maintenance via our SAT phone to discuss the issue and determine best course of action. Continuing to ZZZ2 was ruled out and diversion back to ZZZ1 was decided as the best course of action. Fuel dump would be required to get down to max landing weight. We coordinated with cabin crew for the divert. Advised passengers of the situation and that a return to ZZZ1 was required and was the safest course of action due to the mechanical situation we were having. Obtained clearance from ATC for return to ZZZ1 and clearance for fuel dump. Approximately 20 minutes of dump was completed (approximately 80K lbs. of fuel) and logged. Descent; approach into ZZZ1 were normal until we received an Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System 'Pack Altitude Limit' message indicating insufficient equipment cooling airflow and the equipment cooling is now in the override mode. Normal landing in strong; gusty crosswinds. Taxi to gate normal. After aircraft parking; shutdown and checklists I called to debrief dispatcher; (maintenance controller); FODM (flight operations duty manager). Debriefed ZZZ1 local maintenance on the plane. The entire cockpit crew was very helpful and professional in helping coordinate the divert; fuel dump; etc. during this flight. The extra pilots added a very useful backup during this event to safely return to ZZZ1. Please contact me with any questions or concerns regarding this flight."""
Ambiguous,On ILS Runway 26 approach; in night visual conditions; RA (Radio Altimeter) inop flag appeared on PFD (Primary Flight Display). FO (First Officer) flying on CMD B; with no issues. RA flag replaced by accurate radio altitude at 1;000 ft. down to 900 ft. RA flag reappeared for rest of approach. Auto throttle did not retard to idle at 27 ft. FO disconnected auto throttle after landing. HUD (Heads-up Display) was normal. Ground spoilers deployed normally (auto).Visual to long runway and low altitude delayed looking at QRH until after landing. Warned FO to monitor A/T (autothrottles); but should have had FO disconnect A/T when RA reappeared at 900 ft.[Suggest] Sim Training on potential RA loss.
Environment - Non Weather Related,We were flying the ILS approach to ONT Runway 26R at approximately XA:50Z on Date. I was pilot monitoring. The weather was clear with light winds (night landing). There was no other traffic. There was a NOTAM for 5G interference for ONT in the current NOTAMs. The First Officer; (FO); flew the approach in NAV and PROF on the Scooby-2 arrival all the way in until we intercepted the ILS with the autopilot in APCH LAND. We had Dual Land status after the pre-land test and were cleared for landing. The FO disconnected the autopilot at around 1;000 ft. AGL; as he had briefed. Sometime just below 1;000 ft. AGL I noticed the azimuth for my (Captain) ILS becoming jittery; moving erratically to both sides; often with full deflection. I noticed the FO side was normal. At one point I got a momentary 'ILS untunable' message. The glideslope presentation for my side seemed normal. This continued all the way to landing. The FO's ILS presentation was normal throughout the entire approach. At one point; probably around 200 AGL; I saw an amber 'X' in place of my radar altimeter readout; indicating a radar altimeter failure; though it only lasted for less than one second. It was a normal landing. After blocking in I radioed the tower to tell them what happened; and asked if they had any recent reports of 5G interference. They said they did not have any reports of interference. The tower controller said he would file a report. I made an AML writeup. I can't say for sure whether this was 5G interference but the radar altimeter glitch makes me strongly suspect it could have been. The erratic nature of my ILS presentation appeared to worsen as we came closer to landing. If this had happened in the weather I am certain we would have had to fly off number 2 ILS only; with no autopilot available for landing; and consequently to higher minimums than expected. Possible 5G interference with aircraft instruments.
Aircraft,The events that led to the flight crew's decision-making started with the preflight. We were issued a plane that didn't have a working ACARS system. The Captain decided to adjust the fuel for a more fitting alternate. As the flight progressed; the plane experienced continuous light turbulence with occasional moderate. During a descent for a crossing restriction of 16;000 ft. at the ZZZ1 VOR; the flight crew experienced an autopilot failure. We received an associated EICAS message for the failure. At the same time; we briefly smelled what we believed to be smoke. The flight crew decided that the destination was the best airport to land to. ZZZ and ZZZ2 were our alternates. Given the situation; we didn't feel it [would] be wise to fly [and] extend the flight in the area of a front. We proceeded to ZZZ3; as scheduled. We completed all appropriate checklists.Looking back at the situation; I think the crew should've requested a plane with a working ACARS for better communication. ARINC is always an option but it momentarily takes a crew member out of their flying duties to establish that communication. The situation intensified with the non-favorable weather. The crew contacted ZZZ3 Operations but the radio reception was very weak; at the most critical time.
Procedure,We commenced a normal pushback with Ground Crew pushing us straight back from Gate XX. We were cleared to start both engines. We started the first engine as the Push Crew cleared us off and disconnected from the aircraft. Around that time we had Company aircraft push back next to us on Gate XY to our right. We started the number 1 engine and completed the Before Taxi Checklist.  The aircraft off Gate XY had finished pushing back and began to disconnect from the aircraft. We began the left turn as I coordinated with ramp to taxi Via [Taxiway] 1 to 2. I remember observing the aircraft to our right; our wingtip; then out in front of us to look for any other threats. About halfway through our turn; the Flight Attendant called us to notify that we had scratched wingtips with the other aircraft. I coordinated with ramp to hold position. The Captain started to coordinate with Ops/Maintenance and Dispatch to determine the next course of action. It was decided to shut down both engines and tow us back into Gate XX. We contacted the Chief after we we're parked at the Gate.
Ambiguous,Possible 5G event. On arrival in the terminal area; the crew noticed the autobrakes disarmed twice after arming. I was the PF (Pilot Flying). The PM (Pilot Monitoring) ran the procedure and we set manual braking for the arrival. At 2500 ft. MSL and again at 900 ft.; the CA's (Captain) radar altimeter become inoperative with a red flag. This was noticed by the PM and on his side; CA; only. He did not tell the PF. In the flare I noticed a resistance to pitching up. It almost felt like the autopilot was still engaged. I overcame the resistance to set the landing attitude. Additionally; the AT (Autothrottles) did not go to idle at 27 ft. as normal. I manually closed the thrust levers prior to touchdown. The spoilers worked normally. As the nose wheel came in contact with the runway; the thrust levers started to move forward. I held them back and disarmed the AT. This delayed my engaging the thrust reversers a few seconds. The aircraft was stopped without incident. The Captain wrote up the radio altimeter at the gate.We did not recognize a possible 5G event might be occurring. The CA did not communicate his radio altimeter failure to the FO (First Officer) / PF. If someone gets a red flag on their side; alert the other pilot. The approach should have been flown with the AT off both for the radio altimeter failure and the current 5G policy.
Ambiguous,"Our flight departed from the airport and we were climbing via runway heading as we checked in with our Center controller. He asked if we were on course and I; as Pilot Monitoring; replied back saying we were on runway heading but could be on course if he wanted. He then cleared us direct to a fix on our flight plan. We had previously been told about this traffic at 4;000 ft. and I mentioned about the traffic to my First Officer who was Pilot Flying as we saw him on TCAS. Center said once we are clear of the traffic he will be able to clear us to a higher altitude. As we turned on course direct to our fix; this put us directly aligned with our opposite Cessna traffic. My First Officer was hand flying and we were IMC as I was finishing the after take-off check. We start to level off at 3;000 ft. just as we come within a couple miles of our traffic when I see that the traffic is about 700 ft. above us and descending. We immediately get a 'traffic; traffic' aural sound followed by 'Descend; descend'. We initiate the descent; with me noting our traffic for a split second was 400 ft. above us before returning to a higher number. The Cessna pilot on frequency said; 'That was really close! I informed Center we had an RA with that traffic and we were returning to 3;000 ft. Center replied back saying thanks and we would get higher altitude shortly. Center had verified with the Cessna traffic that they were at 4;000 ft. which the Cessna replied back saying they were. We got handed off to a different frequency and continued our flight to our destination. The main cause of this event was the other traffic not maintaining their assigned altitude. As we were climbing on runway heading I had noticed this traffic on TCAS. When ATC cleared us on course direct to X fix; I noted that this would put us near that traffic. Looking back at the flight; we could have delayed our turn on course with ATC to provide better separation with them."""
Aircraft,During a flight to ZZZ we were discussing landing options; knowing it was going to be a windy approach. Our preference was a flaps 22 landing; but due to the fact the runways are short in ZZZ (possibilities on this day were [Runway] XX or XX) we decided on a flaps 45 landing for safer landing performance numbers. We also preferred and requested to land on Runway XX; however the Approach Controller said they were using [Runway] XX. We continued on our planned route to ZZZ1; then vectors to the RNAV to XX. As we descended the turbulence increased; on final approach we encountered moderate with some severe turbulence. With the sudden severe turbulence encountered the approach became unstable and a go-around was initiated. During the normal process of the go-around we were working with ATC and coming up with our next steps when suddenly PFD 1; MFD 2; FMS 1; NAV 1; RMU 1; RAD ALT; AND ACARS all failed. We exchanged control of the aircraft so I could manage the situation; the QRH was then followed which did not resolve the issues; this all happened while still working with ATC. With building issues we decided to divert to ZZZ2. Also; noting FOB and multiple failures we declared minimal fuel believing if we continued on the planned route we would be in a much worse; unsafe position. Priority handling was received and we were quickly vectored to Runway XXR for a safe landing in ZZZ2. Also; the severe turbulence on final did cause a brief 1 to 2 second flap 45 overspeed to 150 knots.Knowing the sometimes difficult approaches that weather and physical geography have ZZZ flights; a filed alternate on every flight would provide a good safety barrier.  Furthermore; it appears that ZZZ2 to ZZZ often is a tanker route; therefore no additional fuel would be needed to provide this option.  I see this safety barrier as being similar to how; at night; a straight in instrument approach is required.
Aircraft,After taking off from ZZZ-ZZZ1; we were not able to retract the landing [gear]. At around 35 feet with positive rate after calling for gear up; I tried to put the landing gear lever in the up position and was unsuccessful. We notified ATC and told them what had happened and that we wanted to level off at 3;000 feet and get some vectors so we can complete our required checklist. We ran the QRH and decided to return to ZZZ because there was no (LG WOW SYS FAIL MESSAGE DISPLAYED) so the QRH directed us to land at the nearest suitable airport. We completed the QRH and notified Dispatch of our intentions. We also briefed the flight attendants and passengers about the current situation. We never [requested priority handling] or gave any brace commands because the QRH never called for it and furthermore everything was under control and completely safe. While returning back to ZZZ; I suggested that we held for a few minutes to burn off some fuel and avoid an overweight landing. Once we were below max landing weight; we decided to contact ATC for the ILS XX. We landed without any further incident. On the ground we informed Dispatch and Maintenance Control of what occurred and Maintenance responded that they already knew because their system indicated there was something wrong with the nose wheel sensor. We briefed the Gate Agent and passengers and told them that there will be a replacement aircraft landing soon. After we swapped aircraft we departed without any further incident.
Human Factors,Passenger was standing in [the] aisle holding his backpack up and smoke was coming from it; I grabbed fire containment bag; called Captain. Gave containment bag to another passenger; former Pilot/now Corporate Pilot; to take to cabin area where there was smoke Non revenue Flight Attendant seated [who] sprang into action; opening the containment bag. I grabbed halon; PBE and passed it to nonrev pilot who had come forward. Aft Flight Attendant had come forward with halon; had turned lights to bright and instructed pax to stay low because of smoke. I gathered water; juices to wet containment bag. Passed cans to a deadheading Flight Attendant; who had come forward; to take to fire area. Made a PA to have aft Flight Attendant to bring additional water forward. I had only a limited supply. We then formed a human chain passing passenger water bottles to area. Lithium ion batteries were smoldering. Items placed in containment bag and secured in a cart in aft galley. Called Captain to advise fire was out and was advised we were landing in ZZZ. Met by fire / rescue. Taxied to gate without further incident. Firefighters boarded and removed items.Passenger had a host of batteries; chargers; vapes; liquid vape juice. There should be stricter regulations and limits imposed on vaping devices allowed on airplanes.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Our aircraft experienced sudden; violent turbulence due to possible wake turbulence from another aircraft. Flight Attendants B;C; and D were tossed around in the aft galley for about 10 seconds. Shortly after the plane was back in control; a call light rang; and a passenger in the OWWE (over wing window exit row) notified our 'D' Flight Attendant that his heart rate was racing. The D flight Attendant asked for medical personnel on the aircraft; and a passenger came to assist. After the passenger was helped; the ill passenger changed seats and the medical passenger sat in the OWWE; however; she was not briefed before landing.
Procedure,"On Date; MEL 78-XX Logbook Deferral Sheet XXXXXXX was assigned on an overnight maintenance work. We were expected to replace 1 of 2 actuators. The original MEL referenced Eng #1 upper left and upper right thrust reverser actuators failed integrity tests; only 1 of the 2 monitors were noted in the MEL. After additional review it was noted monitor Logbook Deferral Sheet YYYYYYY was to replace the left sleeve upper actuator - outboard; and Logbook Deferral Sheet ZZZZZZZ was to replace the right sleeve upper actuator - inboard. The monitors were inadvertently attached to the component"" and not the airframe.I communicated with planning to add Logbook Deferral Sheet YYYYYYY to the overnight maintenance work for ZZZ to replace the upper left sleeve actuator. I also had Logbook Deferral Sheet XXXXXXX unlocked for MEL deferral as we would only replace one of the 2 actuators. I updated the MEL Logbook Deferral Sheet XXXXXXX stating both monitor items had to be completed for the MEL; stating both actuators need replacement. The 3rd shift AMTs (Aviation Maintenance Technician) assigned used job card X and proceeded with removal and replacement of the upper left outboard actuator. By [the] end of shift the new actuator was partially installed [and] both a written and hands-on verbal turnover were provided to the next shift. Prior to the end of my shift; I again updated the MEL item XXXXXXX deferral. I believed the installation of the actuator would be complete and referenced YYYYYYY and wrote ""replaced upper left actuator"" and that the right actuator replacement was required reference ZZZZZZZ. However; the AMTs that took over the job completed the hook-up and operations and leak checks but were not able to complete the rigging due to lack of tooling.YYYYYYY was deferred and accurately updated with the open rigging steps on the job card. This Logbook Deferral Sheet was open and documented properly; and the thrust reverser still on MEL; when the aircraft departed ZZZ on Date. My MEL deferral statement above was no longer accurate as the replacement was incomplete. The actuator that was removed had remained at ZZZ and was not released for shipping due to some type of processing issue. On Date 1 the store's personnel brought this up to a Crew Chief on duty; the part change was entered on the open MEL Logbook Deferral Sheet XXXXXXX; using the same text I had entered on Date; and that MEL/Logbook Deferral Sheet remained open.Unknown to anyone at the time this part change entry automatically triggered Logbook Deferral Sheet YYYYYYY to be changed from Aircraft X to a mock Aircraft Y. This is an automatic process within the Company system that has created a significant problem at this point; the repetitive check deferral was no longer attached to Aircraft X. This automatic process may be due to attaching the repetitive check deferral to the component; but I do not know this for sure.The right actuator was replaced on Date 2 and since the open repetitive check deferral for the rigging of the left actuator was no longer attached to the Aircraft X; the MEL was cleared. This created an overfly of the open repetitive check deferral. This automated process which sent the repetitive check deferral to the mock aircraft created the failure generating the overfly. This issue started with the lack of tooling in ZZZ needed to complete the replacement of the upper left actuator. The only reason it was deferred after installation was lack of tooling to confirm rigging. Secondarily; the process rolled the open repetitive check deferral to a mock Aircraft Y when a parts change [that] was entered was flawed. It is possible this would not have occurred if the repetitive check deferrals were attached to the aircraft; not the component.Suggestions to avoid recurrence. Have adequate tooling for aircraft maintenance. Ensure Line Maintenance uses the airframe selection for repetitive check deferrals. Attaching to component should only be for shop-level deferrals. Alter the process that rolled the item to a false/mock aircraft."""
Human Factors,While loading mail onto Aircraft X  to ZZZ at  XA40 there was a 5-gallon bucket with liquid inside. I placed it on the side of belt loader to look at later. I called the CSM (Customer Service Manager) on duty out to look at it. I did not load this bucket.I went to pick up the bucket and realized it was full of liquid so I set it aside to figure out what it was a bit later. I called the CSM out to the plane and he was reading the label as I was loading the other mail. He read on the shipping label that it says it is oil in the bucket.Company Y shipped with the post office a 5 gallon bucket full of marine oil.  The post office sent a bucket full of marine oil as mail to be place on a passenger airplane. Company Z (our cargo/mail contract company) loaded the bucket into a cart and brought it down planeside to be loaded.I notified CSM. After flt pushed I brought the bucket into OPS so that they could give it back to Company Z to return to mail facility.Company Y needs to be told that if they ship this mail it can not go onto passenger aircraft. Mail facility that accepted it needed to handle it properly and NOT load anywhere that would get it to be sent on a passenger aircraft. Cargo/mail handlers need to be trained and aware of this type of shipment so it doesn't make it planeside on a passenger aircraft.
Incorrect / Not Installed / Unavailable Part,Aircraft X arrived to Gate XX. During walk-around; found air gap around Blocker Door #3 on #2 ENG INBD Thrust Reverser (T/R). After further inspection it was discovered that a #5 Blocker Door was installed in Position #3. #3 Blocker Door part number is 31-XXXX-X-XXXX. See IPC (Illustrated Parts Catalog) REF 78-XX-XX-XX.Only Blocker Doors #2; #3; and #4 are the same part number. Blocker Door #5 is [a] different part number. Blocker Door #1 is [a] different part number.Further investigation revealed that either #1 or #5 Blocker Door can be installed in #2; #3 and #4 position. But #2; #3 and #4 Blocker Doors can't be installed in either #1 or #5 position. Unable  to find when last maintenance was done on this thrust reverser half or blocker door. This may be a vendor issue installing blocker doors in wrong positions at the time of thrust reverser half build up. Need to pay better attention on building thrust reverser up...never rush or get in a hurry; do the job correct the first time. Safety should always be our #1 priority!!!!!!!
Weather,On approach passing 2;600 ft.; [the] horizontal stabilizer (HSTAB) failed due to icing conditions; causing elevator flight control malfunction. Executed a go-around due to unstable approach. While going around; the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude; airspeed; and heading. Requested modified missed approach and modified missed approach altitude instructions to prevent flying back into known icing conditions.
Human Factors,At XA:25; Aircraft X was approaching to land into ZZZ and doing constant standard advisory calls over the UNICOM. On a straight in 8 mile final for runway XX into ZZZ; a locally hangared Aircraft Y reported to be waiting on the ramp to continue to do VFR pattern work at ZZZ. Upon landing; Aircraft X was still on the active runway of Runway XX and Aircraft Y began to back taxi on the same runway before Aircraft X reported cleared.At XA:55; Continuing out of ZZZ as Aircraft X; Aircraft X was holding short of Taxiway XX and Runway XX. Aircraft Y has just landed and was on the active runway. Aircraft Y advised a suggestion to remain on the runway and told Aircraft X to back taxi onto the active runway. Aircraft X refused and remained to hold short until Aircraft Y was completely cleared. After Aircraft Y fully cleared; Aircraft X continued to back taxi and performed a standard takeoff. On the climb; Aircraft X remained on the UNICOM frequency to track Aircraft Y's intentions. Aircraft Y did not communicate his takeoff. It was only until Aircraft X noticed the traffic target approaching quickly on the ADSB from the rear. The PIC diverted away from Aircraft Y as a preventative measure. To explain how close the aircraft came; banking away from Aircraft Y; PIC of Aircraft X can see Aircraft Y's pilot clearly through their cockpit glass. ZZZ Center also reported a traffic warning with haste and is aware of the situation.
Human Factors,Parking brake inadvertently left on during duration of flight leading to all 4 main tire blowouts upon landing Runway XX; ZZZ. Flight originated ZZZ1 after unloading/loading cargo freight. The parking brake; located a few inches off the floor and out of usual line of sight; is required to be set to the off position in the after start checklist. This item was missed and unnoticed during taxi. During takeoff; the aircraft experienced longer than normal ground roll and a slight yaw at the moment of rotation. I incorrectly diagnosed this behavior as a wind shift and did not discover the incorrect parking brake setting for the remainder of the flight. Upon touchdown Runway XX; ZZZ; the aircraft decelerated abruptly. Some differential power was required to stay on centerline. I estimate that the aircraft stopped about 1;500 feet past the touchdown point. The parking brake setting was discovered a few seconds after the aircraft came to a stop. After setting the parking brake off; I applied roughly 50 percent power in an attempt to move the aircraft. It was apparent that the aircraft was not going to move under its own power. I radioed the FBO informing [them] that I will need a tow. ZZZ airport operations also responded and said they would NOTAM close Runway XX. I also radioed ZZZ Center control informing them that I am currently disabled on Runway XX and ZZZ airport operations will be issuing a NOTAM soon. Upon shutting down and inspecting the landing gear I found all 4 main tires to be blown and sitting on the rims. It did not appear that any more damage had occurred. The aircraft was unable to be towed until at least 1 main tire on each side could be replaced. The aircraft was on Runway XX for about 3.5 hours. Aircraft was returned to service after tires were replaced and signed off by a mechanic. My opinion is that this incident was clearly pilot error and a lack of appropriate checklist usage. Additional company training was conducted with the company Chief Pilot concerning checklist usage.
Human Factors,During takeoff on Runway XXR just after rotation out of ZZZ the pilot flying and PIC (Pilot in Command) informed me that he didn't have trim. At the same time; I was taking a radio call and frequency hand-off and completing the climb checklist. As I completed those tasks and checked in with Departure; the pilot flying and I started troubleshooting and reverting to the emergency elevator trim. We agreed to return to ZZZ since we were still in the traffic pattern on an upwind leg but did not [request priority handling] at this time. I notified Departure that we needed to return to the field. He asked if everything was ok so I told him we were having some trim malfunctions. He asked if we would like to [request priority handling] and I told him no.Around this time the pilot flying asked for the flaps to be brought up. I brought the flaps up while taking radio calls. When the flaps came up the Hydraulic ISOL light on the master warning panel illuminated. At this time the pilot flying and I started to feel like events were starting to build on us and we were feeling busy. This is when we decided to go ahead and [request priority handling]. At some point being vectored back for a visual approach to Runway XXR while the pilot flying was using the emergency elevator trim; he reset the Trim Circuit Breaker and was able to get normal trim back. We also noticed that the hydraulic isolation valve switch was not in the correct position - auto. We flipped the Hydraulic ISOL switch to auto and the light on the master warning panel extinguished. We were on short final at that time so we decided after [requesting priority handling]; etc. - that we were committed to getting the plane back on the ground.After long thought and discussion between the pilot flying and I; we both agreed that somehow the emergency elevator trim switch must have been bumped; which trips the Elevator Trim Circuit Breaker. We also agreed that we failed to do a thorough completion of checklists which caused us not catching the hydraulic isolation valve switch to not be in the correct position.
Human Factors,At XA35z; Aircraft X crossed Runway XR at Taxiway 1 while Aircraft Y began takeoff roll on Runway XR. ASDE alert triggered but Aircraft Y was airborne at the time of the alert from what I can recall. Aircraft X resumed taxi to the Gate. At the time of the incident I was assisting Ground Control (GC) with Clearance Delivery (CD) duties including calling for reroutes and organizing flight plan tickets. Once the incident occurred; I immediately called the Supervisor in the building to the Tower Cab and relief controllers to the Tower. Ground and CD were split off and we resumed normal operations.With the complexity of weather; ZZZ Center stops and swaps; and Runway configuration changes; as the Controller in Charge taking over the position I should have split GC and CD into separate positions. When taking the position I should have assessed the situation and made the determination vs listening to the incoming and outgoing controllers stating the CD position opening wasn't necessary. I've learned from this scenario that I need to constantly reassess Controller workload and staff appropriately during periods of complexity.
Human Factors,We were landing Runways 28 and departing Runways 1. Light rain had been falling for a while and the aircraft were still able to visual in. The finals started to show 'I8L' and '+VSL' indicating that they were setting up for visuals 28R and ILS Runway 28 Left. Also the TRACONs measures were up. Aircraft X checked in for the right and were cleared to land. Then Aircraft Y joined final for the left and were cleared to land. Aircraft Y was above and to the left of Aircraft X probably a mile and a half stagger. The altitudes looked normal until I was talking to Aircraft Y and the Low Altitude Alert went off. I gave them a safety alert stating they were 6 and 1/2 miles final and 1;100 above plus the altimeter. I did not give a reference to SAMML crossing altitude as it is not depicted on the STARS map; and I was not sure if they had crossed it yet. They then showed 1;000 as they acknowledged my transmission. It almost seemed like I surprised them. A short time later I advised back in class bravo; and asked if they had a TCAS RA; no response. I asked if all was good. They said all is good. They continued to a normal landing.About fifteen minutes later we were on parallel ILS approaches. Up until the end of my session (40 minutes later) I could see all of the arrivals visually so I do not think they were descending to avoid weather on a shaky visual or anything like that. I am not sure what to recommend.
Aircraft,While in cruise; both the First Officer (FO) and I smelled what appeared to be an electrical odor. I called back to the Flight Attedent's (FA) to ask if they had any unusual odor in the cabin. They said that they did with a very light haze in the cabin. The FO and I accomplished the QRC for SMOKE; FIRE or FUMES which then lead us to QRH Chapter 8 SMOKE; FIRE or FUMES Checklist. We accomplished steps 1-12. I read step 12 as we had extinguished the source through previous steps. The smell had dissipated as did the haze in the cabin; which in my opinion confirmed that the situation was contained. We then moved to item 13. At that point I contacted Dispatch and informed them of the entire event and discussed with them our options and their preference. I conferred with the FO and all FAs and apprised them that it was my intent to continue on to our destination; but if anyone did not feel comfortable with this decision; that we would divert into ZZZ. At that time we were about 30 minutes east of ZZZ. Dispatch had also said that based on the information that we gave them; and having spoken with Maintenance; asked if we were comfortable to continue to destination. I informed them that we would continue on and would divert to ZZZ if the fumes returned. As I sit and spend more time reading this QRH out of the Cockpit; I could see how maybe we should have have diverted as the smoke; fire or fumes were not 'obvious' although it was obvious through the absence of smell and haze the source was 'isolated and extinguished.'
Aircraft,Flying Aircraft Y; departing from ZZZ using the ZZZZZ X RNAV departure climbing through 10;000 [ft.] the right engine gave two explosives bangs and at the same time resulted in major shaking of the aircraft with N1 showing partial power loss. Flight attendants immediately called saying they heard two loud explosive bangs accompanied by vibrations and a lot shuttering. After going through checklists and contacting company; flight attendants and passengers; we returned to ZZZ.
Aircraft,I refused this aircraft. FAC 1 + 2 had been reset by maintenance 4 times in the previous 7 days. M/C (Maintenance Control) and I both agreed this was unacceptable.
Environment - Non Weather Related,We were taking off on Runway 25R in PHX. At approximately 200 ft.; the Captain's radio altimeter went to negative 6 ft.; the lateral flight director in the Captain's primary flight display disappeared; the amber PWS FAIL (Predictive Windshear) message appeared in both navigation displays; VNAV disengaged and was replaced with the Level Change mode; and the flight director in the HUD disappeared. The First Officer's instrument indicated normal values and did not seem to be affected. At approximately 5000 ft. the indications on the Captain's primary flight instrument returned to normal and stayed normal for the remainder of the flight. The guidance cue (large circle) in the HUD froze in pitch on the horizon line. The flare cue was displayed in the lower half of the guidance cue and the green flare message in the HAP on the First Officer's panel illuminated. These indications did not change throughout cruise and descent. After being established on the ILS; the HUD returned to normal indications. I talked to dispatch and maintenance a few times via the Crew Phone and asked if they would like me to return to PHX for troubleshooting since it is a maintenance base. Since the weather in ZZZ1 was good and the primary instruments were back to normal indications; dispatch and maintenance wanted me to fly to ZZZ1 if possible. I decided to continue since the instruments were working fine. My first thought; when it happened; was a 5G interference; especially since the radio altimeter showed a constant negative 6 ft. All the indications we had are included in the list of possible malfunctions in the 'Potential for 5G Interference of Radio Altimeters' bulletin we received. I am therefore convinced that our malfunctions were triggered by a 5G interference. A 5G interference with our radio altimeter which then caused several additional malfunctions. Retest the specific model of Radio Altimeter in this aircraft. Test the effects of someone in the airplane using a 5G device during take-off or approach.
Aircraft,During climb-out at approximately FL260; both FMC's went blank; [and the] Captain's PFD (Primary Flight Display) had numerous yellow flags. Raw data attitude; speed; and altitude indications were not affected when compared to the standby attitude and FO's (First Officer) instruments; based on the call-outs he was making. AT (Autothrottles) disconnected; autopilot remained engaged but in a degraded state. Complied with QRH for L FMC FAIL EICAS message. Captain's PFD returned to normal after QRH. L FMC FAIL and FMC MESSAGE EICAS Message remained entire flight. During this issue we also had FMC R OUTPUT LOSS scratchpad message. SINGLE FMC R OPERATION scratchpad message at block-in. After completing the checklists and re-automating the airplane; we confirmed we had good lateral navigation from the FMS; but no vertical navigation returned. After discussing why; I noticed the zero fuel weight did not come back after the R FMC was reselected. After re-entering the zero fuel weight; all of the VNAV capabilities returned and operated normally. We continued to ZZZ1 without any more issues. Not sure what caused this issue. We thought originally [that] we had a lightning strike; but ZZZ1 Maintenance found no evidence of one. There was a lot of static electricity and St. Elmo's Fire on the windscreen prior to the FMC failure.
Ambiguous,We were on vectors to final for RNAV 24 approach. We were level at the assigned altitude; 4;000 feet. We received a brief terrain warning. We executed the escape maneuver; notified ATC; and continued the approach normally. ATC informed us that we were at the MVA.
Aircraft,During descent into ZZZ going through about 20;000 ft.; I began to smell an acetone/mek/paint odor in the Cockpit. After two breaths; I donned my mask and performed the Odor Isolation Checklist for the cockpit odor. I maintained my mask for about 4 minutes then removed it and did not notice any smells after that. No physiological effects noted.
Aircraft,Departed ZZZ on Aircraft X to ZZZ1. Upon reaching cruise we had a Fuel Feed Fault light ECAM. We followed the applicable checklist and upon discussion with MX (Maintenance) decided to do a air return. L wing tank fuel burn was or appeared to be significantly more than the R wing tank and C tank didn't seem to be burning as normal. We requested priority handling and accomplished an overweight landing without incident.
Aircraft,Hour and a half out of ZZZ get an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) that comes and immediately goes away. What was that? Then it came back for a little longer: HYD G RSVR LO LVL. And quickly goes away. HYD system page shows low green quantity; just above the amber range. ECAM comes back and stays on. Run ECAM actions; QRH; discuss our understanding together; talk with Dispatch and MX (Maintenance) Control; inform ATC of situation; requesting special handing by ZZZ Tower due to no nose wheel steering after landing; brief inflight and customers. Inflight code yellow; as normal landing expected; except for stopping on runway; and tug to gate. Landed uneventfully on Runway XXL. Super tug to gate; ZZZ MX noted large amounts of hydraulic fluid in gear bay.
Human Factors,We were unloading a ZZZ1 inbound on Date we were short a fleet service clerk initially when the flight arrived; because the other clerk did not show up to the gate. Crew Chief did not give no upload sheet; did not notify that there was a Dangerous Goods package in aft bulk. I realized the event occurred because I was called into the managers office for investigation. Two shop stewards were present.  The event occurred because of poor communication of the crew chief; and the other clerk not showing up on time for the flight. There was no briefing before the flight. They assigned me [late notice] and gave me a rover and I arrived to the flight with no pre-arrival briefing. Proper communication with the Crew Chief and a pre-arrival briefing.
Human Factors,While descending with vectors for the ILS 1 L the First Officer apparently could have copied the 1600 ft. altitude wrong. And dialed 1600 ft. instead of 2600 ft. to cross IAF at ~ 2700 ft. We were advised by ATC of low terrain and corrected accordingly with a go around. We went around and shot the approach again without further incidents. First Officer repeated the altitude but does not remember the number of 1600 ft. or 2600 ft. I dialed (Pilot in Command) 1600 ft. in the dial. Altitude was verified by Second in Command at 1600 ft.; obviously some wrong communication. We admit that we should have challenged the altitude in aftermath. IAF JUTAX is showing an intercept of 2700 ft.
Human Factors,Inbound on the arrival planning Runway XXL. Around ZZZZZ [Intersection] we were told the airport was changing configuration and to plan on Runway XY. We set up for ILS to visual conditions and briefed as such. We were told that Tower had one more departure off of [Runway] XX; but were being given vectors to ILS Runway XY. About two miles outside of  ZZZZZ1 [Intersection]; we were told the Tower couldn't get the ILS turned around and to plan on the RNAV. At first the PM (Pilot Monitoring) selected the RNAV Z but quickly changed the box to reflect the RNAV Y; I think the PM stated it was more appropriate. The baro selector was set to the touchdown zone as we were planning for a visual. After announcing LNAV/VNAV PATH and starting down after ZZZZZ1 [Intersection]; we both said we may need to shoot the full approach as we could not see the airport. Note; after putting this approach in the box; I did quickly go over the waypoints and altitudes. I 'think' I had the PM set his baro selector to the DA for this approach. I also remember thinking I had set my selector as well. Unfortunately; I am pretty certain I changed the altimeter setting to a higher setting. I did not set my baro selector to minimums; as I thought I had. I was in the yellow at that time. While trying to focus; we heard 'Glideslope' numerous times. I almost disregarded it as I was thinking it was not on and was erroneous. This added to my confusion. I have no doubt I had tunnel vision at that time. At some point I heard the PM call out approaching minimums and simultaneously stated 'you are low' as we broke out from the overcast. I looked up to see four red on the VASI. I'm fairly sure I told him I was correcting and immediately added some power and regained two red and two white on the VASI. We did not get any terrain warnings from the GPWS or from the Tower. We landed and turned off the runway and taxied to gate. I was a bit 'spooked' about what had just happened. At the gate the PM and I discussed this event in detail and at some point saw my altimeter setting was wrong.
Aircraft,Approximately an hour into flight; the Captain and I suddenly smelled an acrid burning electrical smell. We accomplished Smoke; Fire or Fumes QRC. I took over flying and ATC; while the Captain ran QRH. Flight Attendants and Passengers also reported smell as well as haze forming mid-cabin. As the Captain turned off components in QRH; haze and smell dissipated. After completing QRH; the Captain conferred with Dispatch; Maintenance; and Crew. All agreed threat was extinguished and flight could be Safely continued to destination.
Weather,The Dispatcher who relieved me filed a report regarding Aircraft X ZZZ-ZZZ1. I planned the flight through an area of forecast ozone. The forecast area was between FL360 TO FL600. I planned the flight at FL380. I do not recall seeing the area on my fusion map.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Flying the ILS 10C into ORD in night VMC conditions around XA:30 local we may have experienced a 5G interference event. Our arrival and approach was normal in every way until I noticed we did not get the automated 100 ft. callout. The only automated callout's we received were 50 ft. immediately followed by a 10 ft. callout. We never received the 100; 40; 30; 20 callout's. Also around 100 ft. the FDGC on HUD disappeared. Sometime after the 50 ft. callout the thrust started to increase so I disconnected the auto-throttle and made a safe visual landing. I wrote up the radar altimeter in the logbook along with a brief description of the flight deck indications on landing. Possible radar altimeter failure or maybe an outside interference to the system. Determine if the problem was an isolated mechanical issue with this particular plane or outside interference such as 5G.
Aircraft,Arrived to the aircraft 55 minutes prior to departure. Walking into the forward galley; I immediately smelled an unidentified odor. Walked into the Flight Deck and was overwhelmed by odor. I initially thought it was a dirty sock smell and assumed it had came from packs. However; aircraft was on ground power with APU and APU BLEED off. My secondary thought was wondering if one of the chillers was leaking refrigerant. Said hello to two of the flight attendants (in first class) and asked if they smelled the odor; they both did. Asked them to come to the flight deck and they both had a strong reaction to the smell. One said she thought it smelled like a dead animal. 43 minutes prior to departure; I called ZZZ Maintenance and described the issue and asked for a Mechanic. Meanwhile; one of the Flight Attendants declared she was developing a headache. I wondered if I was; also; developing the same symptom? I brought all of the Flight Attendants; as well as; the First Officer into the conversation. At the conclusion of the conversation; and in the interest of safety; I communicated with the Gate Agent to hold off on boarding the aircraft. Maintenance told me I needed to write it in the AML but advised me the check would take a couple of hours. I contacted Dispatch and he advised me we had another aircraft across the hall in the other ZZZ terminal. Crew vacated original aircraft; waited on new aircraft to deplane and expedited the boarding process. We got off the Gate 25 minutes late from original departure time and made up some time in flight the best we could.Not knowing what the odor was and feeling like there was a possible correlation between the odor and mentions of headaches made the aircraft a safety concern.
Human Factors,While on a visual approach into MKC at 1500 AGL we had a near miss with a TV tower 2049 ft. AGL. My Captain and I were on our third flight for the day. It was an empty reposition flight from ZZZ1 to MKC and I was assigned as the pilot flying. We had been assigned the TYGER6 arrival into MKC; Information B advised us that visual approaches to Runways 1 and 3 were in use. 5 miles after TYGER ATC advised us to expect the visual to Runway 1 and cleared us direct to MKC. 3.5 miles after passing abeam TRIKE; ATC assigned us a 310 heading and descend us to 4000 ft. At 15 miles out I slowed to 190 KIAS and begun to configure for landing. At 11 miles out I had slowed down to 160 KIAS and continued configuring for the visual approach to Runway 1 into MKC.I was then advised by ATC to keep up my speed as there was an aircraft closing in behind us at 70 KTS. The Controller then advised us that the airport was 12-1 O'clock and 10mi and we should report it in sight. A minute later Controller advised us again that the airport was 12 to 1 o'clock and 8 miles. Both the Captain and I had what we thought was the airport environment insight but neither of us could be sure so we continued on our present heading. 5 1/2 miles out I had the runway insight so the Captain advised ATC that we had the airfield in sight. ATC then cleared us to descend to 2500 ft.; cleared us for the visual approach to Runway 1 and advised us to contact the Tower. We contacted MKC Tower and advise them we are on the visual approach to Runway one. We then completed our configuration for landing and descended to 2500 ft. and I made a turn to the heading of 320; knowing there was an aircraft rapidly gaining on us; I decided to angle my base to a final approximately 2 miles away from the runway. I began a gradual decent and 3 miles out at 1500 ft. AGL I spotted a Tower at our 1 o'clock and 1/2 miles away just as the TCAS system advised us of an obstacle. I immediately bank 30deg left added full power and begun a climbing turn away from the Tower. The Captain called for and took the flight controls; we call a missed approach and we got vectored back around and landed safely at MKC. After considering the factors involved in how this situation could be avoided in the future; I realized that I had allowed myself to be rushed by the Controller.Instead of taking my time and squaring up my base and making my final turn 5 miles out like I knew I should have; I subconsciously choose to hurry up and try to expedite my landing for the traffic behind me. Having had two busy days full of cold weather ops and constant IMC flying my reduced performance and decision making was definitely a factor. While flying from ZZZ1; the Captain and I discussed that there was no ILS to Runway 1; although it was the larger and longer runway. In hindsight it should have been a clue for me to very carefully look over the obstacles and terrain in the vicinity of the approach to Runway 1. Had I done that I would have seen the towers noted near the approach and would have been very cautious.
Environment - Non Weather Related,I was working Sector X. ZLA [Sector] XY handed me off Aircraft Y; at FL290; requesting FL330 as a final. Aircraft X was handed off about 7 miles behind at FL310. Aircraft Y was slightly slower (about 5 knots; give or take). After updating Aircraft Y on the rides at FL330 (intermittent light chop); I climbed them to FL330 to ensure I had enough time to get them above with the slight overtake. They passed FL310 just west of ZZZ1 (about 5 miles or so). At that time; Aircraft X reported moderate turbulence; bordering on severe. I told the pilot that was my first report of anything more than light chop; then told the supervisor; and; after asking the supervisor if it was needed; asked the pilot if they any injuries or structural problems. The other pilot on Aircraft X then said that it wasn't really severe; but definitely moderate. Aircraft Y then suggested that it was probably them since they two were about 7 miles apart and Aircraft X probably got into the wake of the A321 as they were climbing. The Aircraft X pilot said that was most likely.Earlier in the day; I was on [Sector] YX; having just given a relief briefing. I moved to the D side to help with a flight plan on a no notice F16 split up. There were two A321s climbing off ZZZ2; about 7 miles apart. The back one started complaining about the wake and deviated off course to the right without a clearance. They didn't get within 3 miles of military airspace; but it was pretty close. Sorry; I don't remember the call signs.In the enroute environment; heavy aircraft are not the only ones generating large amounts of wake turbulence. B738s and 9s do as well; and A321s. This is especially problematic with regional aircraft (E75L/CRJs etc) and biz jets. In these two cases; the two aircraft were comparable types; but the front aircraft was generating enough wake turbulence to cause problems with the trailing aircraft. RECAT has been implemented in the terminal environment at many airports; but there has been nothing done in enroute; with the exception of a briefing on the A380; which has been mostly negated by the fact that it isn't flown that much anymore. I think we need more briefings on wake events; information given to controllers on wake turbulence characteristics as they differ between different aircraft; an implantation of RECAT in enroute (with the understanding that 5 miles is not always adequate); a requirement implemented to call traffic based on the actual type instead of a generic 'Airbus' designator as well as traffic information exchanged whenever following problematic types within 10 miles; and the development of a tool to detect wake turbulence conditions that could be worse in certain situations (such as little wind where the wake does not dissipate).In addition; I think a work group should be convened to address these issues; with; at a minimum; the NATCA A114 wake rep.I give permission to allow for the full uncensored version of this report; in its entirety; to all parties.
Manuals,Upon entering the aircraft; the brake accumulator pressure was 2;000 psi. The previous Crew reported no issues with the pressure. Turning the B electric pump on immediately brought the pressure back to 3;000 psi. When the pump was turned off; the pressure fell to 2;000 psi in a few seconds. I reported the issue to Maintenance who responded to the aircraft. While troubleshooting the issue; the AMT asked if the previous Crew had waited 10 seconds between turning the A and B electric hydraulic pumps off. The previous Crew had departed; so we were unable to determine the answer. When I asked why he wanted to know this; he responded that the Maintenance manual directs a ten second delay to make sure a shuttle valve has time to complete travel on MAX aircraft. Pilots do not have this guidance; and routinely turn both pumps off at the same time or in quick sequence as part of the shutdown flow. I've experienced low accumulator pressure on several MAX aircraft over the last few months resulting in flight delays; so I thought I should forward this concern.
Weather,The flight was normal; no delays; normal take off in ZZZ. We leveling up at cruise altitude and wait until better turbulence conditions out off [the] ZZZ area. At better conditions let the passengers up and I did my announcement about our conditions. After a couple hours; the Captain checked a message via ACARS and discovered a couple messages about to avoid ozone areas in our route but that areas was almost two hours ago off that time. We received all the messages at once too late to avoid it. We passed that ozone area with no physiological conditions on our passengers or crew. We never received the advance on time to about that situation. The Captain sent a message to Dispatch to notify that we received the messages at the same time almost two hours late.
Procedure,Tires loaded on aircraft when they should be trucked.
Ambiguous,While on the ILS approach to Runway 24 at BHM; while in IMC conditions and passing through 400 feet AGL the aircraft announced '50 feet' then '40 feet' (while the aircraft was at approximately 400 feet AGL) then the RADALT fail indication illuminated and the throttles attempted to retard. The CA (Captain) overrode the throttles and continued the approach. At 200 feet minimums the aircraft broke out of the overcast layer. As the aircraft continued to descend; the aircraft did NOT read out the normal '50/40/30/20/10 foot' calls as normal.Suspected 5G interference causing incorrect RADALT indications.Suggestions - Remove 5G antennas from the vicinity of BHM airport.
Aircraft,Conducted OE (Operating Experience) with NH (New Hire) FO (First Officer); FO was PF (Pilot Flying). On Departure SID; leveled off at FL260; in IMC; TAI (Thermal Anti-Ice) on. Shortly after reaching FL260 we saw IAS DISAGREE on CA (Captain) and FO PFDs (Primary Flight Displays). FO's airspeed read about 25 knots less than CA's. Ran Airspeed Unreliable checklist but could not determine which airspeed; if any; was reliable. No probe heat failure was indicated. FO was hand flying aircraft in IMC at FL260 without AP (Autopilot); AT (Autothrottle) or FD (Flight Director). I decided to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ1. Received vectors back to airport for ILS XXC. Planned overweight landing and ran that checklist too. While on vectors to Runway XXC; the IAS DISAGREE messages disappeared from both PFDs and airspeed indications appeared normal again. Continued to ZZZ1 and landed uneventfully but overweight at 150;500 lbs. Landed smoothly and let airplane roll down runway; ARFF confirmed no hot brakes and followed us to the gate. I checked with one of our Technical Pilots two days later to see if a cause for the IAS DISAGREE had been determined. I was told that the FO's pitot tube had been replaced and the airplane had been returned to service.We were in IMC and icing conditions at the onset of the event but engine anti-ice had been selected on as soon as we entered IMC conditions. Again; no indication of a TAI or probe heat failure. Even though the malfunction cleared during decent while on vectors for the approach; I elected to stay with the plan of returning to ZZZ1 without delay which I had communicated to ATC; Dispatch; the FAs and PAX (Passengers). This report is informational only. I have no suggestions.
Aircraft,Upon arrival to the plane in ZZZ; a couple of the flight attendants and the first officer; informed me that there had been an unpleasant smell like cleaning solution or a dead animal on the plane but that it had dissipated.  I asked if they were sure it was not a electrical or dirty sock smell (indicative of burned oil getting in the packs)  They assured me it was not.  The smell did not reoccur until in the air: Near the top of climb or just after leveling off; we got a SMOKE CREW REST F/D EICAS caution message.  As this EICAS caution does not have an enunciated checklist and there was no evidence of fire or smoke. I contacted the flight attendants and asked that they check the crew rest area and we began the Smoke; Fire or Fumes checklist.  Moments later; the EICAS caution message disappeared.  The flight attendants reported that they briefly smelled something like cleaning solution when they opened the crew rest door but that it dissipated almost immediately.  The first officer and I decided we should consult maintenance control through SATCOMM.  Before we connected with the dispatcher; the EICAS message briefly reappeared and disappeared.  The EICAS warning did not reoccur again after the second time.  After considering all the evidence; maintenance advised us that it would be OK to continue the flight.  We asked the flight attendants to contact us immediately if they smelled; felt; or saw anything indicating smoke or fire.  The cruise portion of the flight continued without incident; but we remained attentive to possible alternates should anything more occur.  Just before the top of descent; we received a call from the flight attendant in the back of the aircraft.  We had just received our descent clearance into ZZZ1 and a runway change from the ILS 12 to the RNAV Z 12 which generated discontinuity in the arrival.  (an anomaly) We both needed to be present to straighten this out; so I informed the flight attendant that I had to go to get the plane on the ground.About one minute after clearing the runway and before starting the APU; we received a call from the back of the aircraft from a flight attendant reporting an electrical smell.  (It was quite confusing as a slight majority of the flight attendants were reporting the smell of cleaning solution and this one thought it smelled like electrical.)In light of that description; we asked ground control to send the fire department to meet us at the gate.  (I didn't anticipate an evacuation; but felt it was imperative to get the passengers off the plane as soon as possible to avoid the inhalation of fumes should they have occurred.  This is why we proceeded to the gate and asked the fire department to meet us at the there.  Thinking that the smell couldn't be coming from the APU as it was not running when the smell was reported after landing nor during climb; we started the APU so that we could shut down the engines and emergency deplane at the gate should it be necessary.The fire department didn't find any evidence of fire inside the passenger compartment; the baggage compartment; the exterior or any other part of the plane.  Maintenance came on board and asked us to shut down the APU as they all agreed that it was burned oil or hydraulic fluid they could smell; the passengers and flight attendants were off the plane at that point; so I instructed the cleaners to leave the plane and we shut down the APU and left the plane to the mechanics.  Unfortunately; after I left the plane; I was informed from the Chief Pilot in ZZZ that one of the flight attendants had complained to her supervisor about how the situation was handled.  We had very little time to deal with both calls from the back of the plane as we were task saturated in both cases and our priority was getting the plane where it needed to be.   Apparently; something was wrong with the airplane which allowed the odor of burned oil or hydraulic fluid to intermittently enter the cabin.  It isn't really possible to determine if an odor is a threat from it's characteristics (how it smells). In the future; if there is a smell on an aircraft; I will follow the Aircraft Odor - Ground checklist (which I didn't realize existed.) and make an entry in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook no matter what the odor smells like.
Aircraft,Climbing through 17;000 feet HYD 3 ELEV OFF Level 1 followed by momentary HYD 3 OFF Level 1. HYD system at 4.0 and decreasing. Eventually went to 0.0 with a HYD 3 FAIL Level 2. Cleared to FL300; but requested hold down at FL250. Read through QRH and opted to request priority handling and return to ZZZ. Complied with QRH and landed ZZZ Runway XXR via visual backed up by RNAV XXR. Taxied clear with a left turn onto Taxiway 1 then left onto Taxiway 2 and stopped. QRH states that nose wheel steering to the right is limited so we opted for a tow back to the gate.
Human Factors,While pulling into gate X I saw a large crew bus on the service road that did not yield. I immediately stopped the aircraft half way through my turn. The bus continued to encroach into my path. Finally the driver saw me and stopped the bus then backed up behind the safety line. I continued into parking and shutdown with no further incident. There was no damage or injury noted to our jet or crew. The First Officer advised Ground Control of the incident.The bus driver was not paying attention and did not yield to our aircraft.
Human Factors,During preflight of flight release we saw we had a deferred APU.  After receiving the preliminary weight and balance; Dispatcher sent us an ACARS; stating that we will be operating under supplemental Dry Ice procedures. my first officer; and I both agreed we didn't think we could do that. I then called our Dispatcher and asked him about it;  with his explanation which was that they were going to load the upper [cargo bin] with 952 kgs and the forward belly with 264kgs;  according to the dispatcher; that would keep us under the limits of the MEL (XX-XX-XX-A). I had the MEL open while talking with dispatcher; and I saw the numbers he was talking about. So; I agreed that we met the MEL limits.  We (the Crew); decided we would continue flight under the Dry Ice Supplementary procedures as outlined in QRH; with the exception of the APU usage.  After departure and while climbing to cruise altitude; I just kept having a feeling that wasn't the correct thing to do; so after TOC; I started talking with the FO about it; after about 15 minutes and looking at the MEL for the 5th time; I had finally found MY error.  The MEL; XX-XX-XX-A; does have maximum dry ice limits for the upper and forward cargo compartments; but; if I had read further down; it also has a maximum dry ice for ALL cargo compartments; basically max amount of dry ice allowed..which was 966 kgs..we had roughly 1200 kgs of dry ice on board.   This was my mistake; not the FO; and not the dispatcher; I failed to read and interpret the MEL correctly.  Once we landed in ZZZ1; I informed the off load crew to vent the aircraft before entering for offload. In my opinion; other than my failure to read all and interpret the MEL correctly; I believe this MEL; should have the maximum dry ice of 966 kg highlight a different color from the other limits.  Also; I believe the words ( Supplementary dry ice procedures are not allowed) written in bold letters in remarks sectionWhen something feels like it is incorrect; take the time to discuss the situation until it feels correct. I should have taken more time to look at MEL longer;   Also change the MEL to actually state; supplementary dry ice procedures not allowed
Human Factors,We were on approach to [Runway] XXL. Weather in the area consisted many areas of moderate to heavy precipitation. Approach controllers seemed overworked as assigned speed was not gradual reduction but rather assigned to slow from 190 to 170 to 150 in a very short period of time. Our speed control was good and we were configured and on speed prior to ZZZZZ [intersection]. While on the approach I started to see a bright light appear in the FO side window. Visibility from the rain was obscuring the image but it was evident that it was another aircraft. I queried my FO as to what they were doing and told him I was getting uncomfortable with what was happening. I got to a point where I was no longer willing to accept what was happening and started to move toward a defensive position. I decided to turn off the autopilot and turn away from the traffic at the same time ATC started giving commands to turn left immediately. I turned away from the traffic aggressively and received the bank angle warning along with the RA call. I continued to scan from the PFD back to the other aircraft to make sure we were getting away from them. I could tell that we were below and to the left of him and that he appeared to be turning away from us. Although the visibility was low; it was evident that the interfering aircraft was an air carrier. Glancing back at the PFD I saw that escape guidance was displayed. It went away almost as soon as I realized it was there. I do remember it showing to not climb. Once the conflict was clear we queried ATC for a heading and altitude. Once the new clearance was received; I pushed the GA paddles and we executed the go-around procedure. We were sequenced back in to the arrivals and eventually landed without further incident. I called the duty officer to report the near mid air collision. Dispatch took the information and said she would reach out if any further information was required. Dispatch asked if we were alright to continue. I assured them that we were; but would like to recognize how important I thought it was that she asked.Cause - This event was caused by an aircraft transgressing our flight path. In my opinion the transgressing crew and ATC agency had a breakdown. Suggestions - Flight crews need to continuously monitor traffic around them especially during low IMC approaches. ATC needs to be vigilant when they are dealing with this much traffic during low IMC approaches and prevent incursions of this nature.
Aircraft,Approximately XA05Z got several dropped SATCOM calls.  At XA07Z; got ACARS message indicating HYD 3 Fail.  Acknowledged the flight's message and opened QRH while calling Maintenance Control.  During discussion with Maintenance Control; flight began the turn around back to ZZZ. Contacted ZZZ Tower to advise of issue and of the flight's limited right turn capabilities after landing.  ZZZ Tower confirmed the flight [requested priority handling].  Advised ZZZ Tower that fuel dump would most likely not be necessary.  Coordinated with Maintenance Control after decision was made to land Runway XR for tug in from taxiway.
Human Factors,This morning I took Aircraft X to ZZZ with cargo. The aircraft was parked in the north row at Company A; facing the building and narrow alleyway. The ramp had 1-3 inch snowdrifts; and all lines and markings were not visible on the Company A's ramp. During my preflight; I thoroughly inspected the wings while brushing them off; and no abnormalities were detected. After pulling out into the alleyway; I recognized the hazards of the taxi environment being a lack of visible markings; occasional reduced visibility from blowing snow; and less than perfectly clear flight deck windows. I removed 90-95% of the snow and ice from the windows with the brush and windshield heat; but some distortion remained. Without the lines to guide me; I did my best to taxi in the center of the lane; and follow the guidance of the marshalling crew. I scanned left; center; right continuously while taxiing at 1 kt. (very slow walk). There appeared to be an equipment rack on the left side of the alley that was going to be close to the aircraft; so I nudged the plane right approximately 6 inches. All marshallers continued to guide normally with no indication that I would hit that equipment. As I got closer to it; I still thought I was too close and deviated right another 6-12 inches. During one of my scans to the left immediately adjacent to the rack; I noticed a small amount of snow appear to fall off of that equipment. I did not feel an impact; and did not see the plane make contact with the equipment; and believed that the snow could have fallen due to wind or prop wash. As I made the right turn to proceed out of the alley; I did notice the Lead Marshaller shouting to the left wing walker and I was beginning to believe that I may have hit the equipment. I stopped at the exit of the alley; and the Marshall came to the plane followed by the Mechanics. The Marshaller confirmed to me that I had hit the equipment; after which I assumed I would need to stop and be inspected. The Mechanics assessed the damage and gave me hand signals to let me know I was safe to continue with the flight. I knew that if I were to park the plane and inspect the damage myself; I would most likely agree with; and accept the word of the Mechanics that the aircraft was airworthy. As such; I proceeded to de-ice; and had an uneventful flight in VMC.A few suggestions here; first one for myself. Aircraft X was my second plane of the morning; Aircraft Y had a generator fail during my taxi out; and I had to return to Company A and swap planes. I certainly felt pressure to complete the mission as soon as possible; as the route was already 2 hours late by this point. The most prudent thing for me to have done would have been to park; shut down; and inspect the wing myself. I don't know if me doing so would have had resulted in changing aircraft again; but after seeing the damage after landing in ZZZ1; I believe I most likely would have continued in Aircraft X if the Mechanics believed it to be safe. I certainly don't want to lay blame on anyone other than myself; I was the PIC (Pilot in Command) and all events that transpired were my responsibility. That being said; the wing walker on the left had the sole responsibility of helping me avoid obstacles on that wingtip. That wing walker took no action to prevent the impact. Additionally; they did not have me stop and have the aircraft inspected immediately after the impact. Had I not stopped at the end of the alley; I wouldn't have known about the impact until arriving in ZZZ1. I know from conversations with other pilots and our employees that Company A marshallers and wing walkers are not always as proficient as they should be; and may not fully understand what to do in this type of situation. I strongly suggest action be taken to remedy this. Also; I understand that it isn't necessarily feasible to plow that entire alley; but the red lines and the centerline should most certainly be clear before being utilized by aircraft.
Aircraft,Aircraft had MEL and APU generator button remained out as per crew procedure. Flight was uneventful until landing. After touchdown Engine 2 reverser amber and Engine 2 [reverser] disagree message. I announced spoilers; one reverser. Continued without incident and exited runway. After landing checklist was performed and after one minute idle/taxi thrust called for standard taxi. As number one was spooling down the electrical system acted as though dc bus two failed indicated by Multi-function Flight Display 1 and Primary Flight Display 2 screens blank. Except we still had Multi-function Flight Display 2 and RMU 2 and associated nav/com; transponder indicating IC 600 2 had power; and we still had nose wheel steering. The stick shaker was continuously active and we had a cascading set of master warning and caution messages and stopped the aircraft.The cabin pressure began rising rapidly and my focus then shifted to passenger safety. We ran the Quick Reference Handbook for pressurization automatic control failure (EAP 1-13) and regained control of the cabin pressure. The Flight Attendant called and said the emergency lights were on and I told her that we had an electrical issue; no emergency; keep everyone seated and we'd continue taxi momentarily. We ensured Engine 2 associated gens were showing online but I elected to restart number one for the additional 2 gens. We continued to the gate on both engines. When we set brake at the gate I gave the signal for GPU. The GPU was connected and verified 28 volts but I could not select the GPU with the button.The ground crew then opened the baggage door so I immediately shut down both engines. Keep in mind the beacon was on indicating that engines were running so I was alarmed to see the bag door opened. We deplaned passengers in an unpowered aircraft. I contacted maintenance to write up both the reverser and electrical issue. We were unable to select the GPU and neither batteries were controllable via battery selector knobs.Maintenance had me perform an electrical reset and seemed to fix the issue. I had a conversation with the Ground Personnel and asked them why they opened the bag door with engines running. They didn't notice that the beacon was on (it may have not been working as we had a plethora of electrical faults so I'll give them the benefit of doubt on not seeing a beacon); but...apparently didn't notice the running engines. Maintenance arrived at the gate to test the reversers and cabin pressurization and we swapped to a different jet to continue the trip.
Aircraft,During initial climb; passing about 8000 feet an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) Cargo Smoke Warning occurred; but then quickly stopped and went away. However; the last page; only; of the ECAM Actions for cargo smoke was displayed on the STS (Status) page. Moments later; passing through about 10000 feet the same warning recurred and again stopped and vanished. The STS continued to display the same last page.Since we [were] coasting-out and were unable to determine whether or not we were on fire; and unable to determine if the warning was for the for the forward or aft cargo compartment; I transferred aircraft control and ATC communications responsibilities to the First Officer; with the command to request priority handling and return to the departure airport ASAP.We each completed our divided duties and re-joined as a crew; so to speak; on about a 10 mile final. Although we were about 21;000 pounds above maximum landing weight; First Officer rolled the aircraft onto the runway as smooth as could be and brought us to a stop on the center line. I found the procedure of calling 'My Aircraft' and the onset of both warnings very helpful. And the method of dividing responsibilities; i.e.; 'Your aircraft; your radios' to serve us perfectly as well.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Vectored and cleared for 16R in SEA. They gave us a wind report with light winds out of the west and following a 757. We had airspeed trends all the way down that made me think the reported winds were wrong but the Captain kept it stable. We got a quick 50 / 40 call and the Captain added a substantial amount of power. We got an aural 'warning' and the Captain immediately initiated a go around. We came back to do it again with none of the previous issues. It made me think we might have been in the wake turbulence of the 757 all the way the way down. Possible wake turbulence of the preceding plane. Greater separation when winds might be keeping the wake turbulence in the path of the next aircraft.
Aircraft,During cruise flight; we received an L HYDRAULIC SYSTEM PRESSURE and RUDDER RATIO EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System). We executed the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) procedure 3.1.5.Due to the checklist including the apparent possibility of losing further system pressure or quantity and more system degradation; we opted to requested priority handling with ATC and have the emergency crews standing by. We got direct routing to ZZZ1 and landed without further incident. Probable failure of the engine driven hydraulic pump.
Aircraft,During climbout we received a level 2 HYD 1 OFF alert. The hydraulic 1 reservoir showed zero quantity fluid remaining and the hydraulic 1 system pumps turned off. We followed the procedure in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook); and after consulting with Dispatcher and Maintenance Control via SATCOM; we proceeded to ZZZ. On initial contact with ZZZ Approach control we requested priority handling and requested a landing on Runway XXC. After landing we cleared the runway and the fire department checked the aircraft over. They reported hydraulic fluid still leaking on the left side and directed us to shut down our #1 engine. After confirming that everything else looked good we terminated the emergency; started the APU; and shut down the remaining engines. We were towed the remaining distance to the gate by Company maintenance.
Ambiguous,Aircraft received 2 different false altitude reporting from the radar altimeter. On departure while climbing through 2;300 ft. MSL received 1;000 ft. radio altitude call out. While climbing through 11;600 ft. MSL received 10 foot radio altitude call out and auto-throttles disconnected.
Human Factors,On arrival into the airport we shot the instrument approach to the opposing runway per the briefing guide. Upon visual contact of the airport and surrounding terrain we called center and requested a visual approach to the opposite runway due to the straight in approach exceeding the max tailwind limit. We began our visual approach as outlined in the briefing guide. On our base turn around the mountain; with strong winds pushing us away from the airport; we were following the contour of the terrain and received a EGPWS terrain warning. The entire approach was conducted in VMC well above the minimums for this maneuver. Upon receiving the warning I slowed the decent rate of the aircraft and the warning stopped. The aircraft was never in an unsafe position to land or in danger of hitting any of the surrounding terrain. The runway was insight when we received the EGPWS warning. We continued to line up on final for the runway and were on the PAPI.The first factor in this event is a lack of recency of experience. I had been checked out by a check airman for this airport over a year prior to this flight. This was also my first flight back without a check airman. Most approaches here end up being straight in with the ILS but the winds that day did not allow for that and we had to shoot the 'visual' approach to the opposite runway. The second cause of this event was my inexperience in this maneuver and the strong south west winds leading to us go past the 9 DME arc.This event could have been avoided by a better description of what is expected on the briefing guide. If there was a video link showing this approach or a google earth type picture that detailed what we were expecting to see that would have been helpful. This 'visual' approach to Runway XX is unlike any other type of flying that is done outside of the program. I understand that there is no way to have multiple checkouts for this airport but there should be a recency of flight expectation before a Captain is sent to ZZZ. With very little 700 flying for junior line holders and no ZZZ flying besides the initial checkout makes this maneuver even more challenging. My last suggestion is for any Captain checked out for ZZZ if there is anytime left over during a sim session a quick review of this procedure would be extremely valuable.
Aircraft,We received the aircraft from another flight crew who stated the aircraft was 'fine' and only had the Nose Wheel steering switch off set vertically by about 20 degrees. I visually confirmed that the switch was offset vertically; and still moved and functioned appropriately. I asked my First Officer check the nose gear carefully during her walk around. She came back and stated everything was good outside. We continued normal operations.During the initial climb after rotation; I remarked during gear retraction that 'the nose wheel seemed awfully loud' and it successfully retracted with no sensor errors reported on the Flight Deck. The noise ceased on gear retraction. We continued our flight as normal. During approach and landing; the nose gear did not make any noise different than as expected on our day to day operations. Touch down of the main gear was fine; until the nose wheel made contact with the runway.The aircraft began to steer right at about 2-3 degrees a second; which I immediately began applying opposite rudder. When that was not working; I add right only brake to bring the aircraft nose back toward center line. Then the nose started going to the right at 2-3 degrees a second. I swapped inputs to left rudder and brake. Once the aircraft nose started coming back left; I applied strong brake pressure on both mains and slowed down to a speed where I could safely exit the runway. This all happened in the span of 5-10 seconds. As the aircraft slowed down; it was more under control; than at the higher ground speed upon landing.After we taxied to the gate; I had my First Officer do a walk around and asked her to check the nose carefully; as I called Maintenance. When she came back she remarked how the Nose was 'fully extended;' in which the Maintenance Controller remarked that 'the swerving would be attributed to an over extended nose strut.'The next day I spoke with a crew that was ferrying the aircraft out of ZZZ; and explained the entire narrative above. The Captain was very appreciative; since this 'filled in the gaps' for what his ferry flight was for.
Ambiguous,Captain was flying the leg. Immediately after rotation from Runway 34 in HPN the first officers RA flagged and showed negative 5 ft. That continued until approximately 1;400-1;500 ft. Then normal RA indications resumed. This only occurred on the first officers Primary Flight Display. We notified Tower of the RA issue and continued the flight. After reaching cruise we experienced a hydraulic door open ICAS message. After completing the Quick Reference Handbook I contacted [Commercial Radio] for a phone patch to my Dispatcher and Maintenance Control. After speaking with Maintenance we agreed that it was a possible door switch malfunction and the flight was safe to continue to ZZZ. The entire process with the phone patch took approximately 45-50 minutes. After this I set the plane up for a normal arrival into ZZZ. We landed with all indications normal. I wrote up the hydraulic door indication but forgot to write up the possible 5G interference. I was busy contacting Local Maintenance to tell them about the hydraulic door issue which was on the fore front of my mind. I usually write up items at cruise altitude but was busy dealing with Maintenance Control and the door open issue that I forgot about the 5G issue.
Aircraft,Fume event. ZZZ takeoff to ZZZZ. Passing 3;000 ft. had odor in galley and cockpit. Number 1 FA (Flight Attendant) went on oxygen. Both me and FO (First Officer) also dawned mask. Diverted to ZZZ1 with an overweight landing.
Aircraft,While operating Aircraft X; from ZZZ1 to JFK; we were notified at about the midway point in the flight; that JFK had dropped below category 1 minimums. ATC asked if we would be able to accept a category 2 or 3 approach. We informed ATC that we were unable to accept a category 2 or 3 approach due to the lack of an alternate means of compliance on the Aircraft X for any runway at JFK for the 5G NOTAM restrictions. We were then put into holding until the weather improved. While in holding; we contacted Dispatch; and once it was apparent that the weather was not improving; we coordinated with Dispatch; and diverted to ZZZ2. After we landed in ZZZ2; we refueled and waited for the weather to improve; and once the weather improved; we departed for JFK and landed without any further issues.
Ambiguous,On final visual approach into RSW Runway 06; we received a traffic advisory from TCAS for three aircraft in close proximity. There was no traffic and prior to our arrival; another airline reported a similar issue. Tower asked both the airline and us to file a report as it was possible 5G interference.
Aircraft,Radio altimeter intermittently worked between 600 and 1500 AGL on climbout. No other issues. Possible interference due to jamming; spoofing to aircraft; radio Altimeter; 5G or cellular.
Aircraft,On approach into ZZZ; ILS PRM (Precision Runway Monitor) XXC; hand flown with auto throttles engaged. Vectored close behind another aircraft on the same approach. The airplane was configured flaps 20 with the gear up. Used speed brake to manage the ATC assigned airspeed of 170 kts.I retracted the speed brake to the stowed detent and moved my hand to the throttles. As I was moving my hand and neither touching the speed brake lever or the throttles; I visually noticed the flight director on the HUD move to a climb attitude and the FMAs change to THR/LNAV/TOGA. I moved my hand down to stop the throttles but they had advanced past where I had expected them to be; at which time I moved my head to visually see them advanced forward. I began to move the throttles back to maintain the approach and fly it raw data; but decided that I would become unstable. I told the Captain that we were going around. The additional thrust had caused the airplane to start to climb; so instead of unloading the airplane I stopped the nose up movement and made the go around calls. The Captain informed the Tower of the go around. We were instructed to maintain 6000 ft. We had already climbed through that altitude and began a descent back to it. I reengaged the autopilot and the Captain ran the checklists. ATC vectored us around for another ILS PRM XXC. After a brief discussion; I hand flew the approach with the autothrottles disengaged to a normal landing. The Captain submitted a discrepancy 'AUTOFLT SYS DIRECTED UNCOMMANDED GA DURING APPROACH'. An avionic Technician met the airplane to discuss with us what had happened. We briefed him and left to fly our next leg.
Aircraft,Started in ZZZ early in the morning. FO (First Officer) who has his airplane mechanic cert states that during the walk around he saw the right main strut was deflated. I checked it out and it was showing 1/2 inch. I call Maintenance to have it inspected. Maintenance argues on the phone asking if I really want to write that up. I tell them the limitations and say yes. After some delay we push for ZZZ1 with gusty winds forecasted. WS 015/22060kts. Release states ZZZ2 alternate for forecasted windshears.At around 500 ft. we get a stall fail caution. We continue the climb and clean up the aircraft. After cleaning up we do the QRH which states 'Note: Windshear guidance will not be available; Windshear fail status message will appear' we continue the climb and consider our options. Windshear fail status message did not appear but the checklist stated that we would not have guidance. We contacted Dispatch asking for clarification with Maintenance. They answer that yes indeed; we do not have windshear guidance. We start looking at ZZZ1 and the gusty winds. Our filed alternate is ZZZ2 with a similar forecast. Ask if there are windshears in ZZZ1. Dispatch says no. We ask ATC if ZZZ1 is reporting windshears. Center reaches out to ZZZ1 and says yes; ZZZ1 is reporting LLWS. We relay the message to Dispatch.Dispatch comes back saying ZZZ1 is reporting +-15 kts. on final and no windshears. Sounded strange to us. We get handed off to the next Controller and ask him to confirm since the last Controller said there were windshears. It takes them about 10-15 minutes to get back to us and he says: yes we reached out to ZZZ1 Center and they said LLWS. Okay; FO (First Officer) and I talk about the situation and figure we can't go to ZZZ1. We relay the message to Dispatch saying ATC reports LLWS in ZZZ1 again and we are going to divert. Dispatch answers 'I req you continue'. This did not seem safe at all with no stall protection and no windshear guidance. We clearly had conflicting information. We opted to take the safest course and told Dispatch we were diverting to ZZZ3. Advised ATC and used CA (Captain) authority to divert to ZZZ3 which was not our filed alt. Dispatch then sends us an ACARS stating' I have the director of flight and The ZZZ2 ACP (Assistant Chief Pilot) on the phone and we req that you continue'. This blew me away completely. I deliberated for a second about what to do even though we had already turned towards ZZZ3. Decided the safest option was still to divert to ZZZ3. Messaged Dispatch we will talk about it on the ground and we need numbers for ZZZ3. Was worried about getting fired on the spot the whole flight to ZZZ3. I see now that this was probably an emotional reaction. However; this is not something I should be worried about while diverting after having [advised ATC]. Landed safely in ZZZ3. Upon landing and talking to management we did the GPWS test and the GPWS fail status message remained posted on ED2. We swapped planes to go to ZZZ1 but at this point ZZZ1 went into a ground stop due to winds. Windshear advisories were posted in the ATIS at this time. I truly hope this was a misunderstanding between management; dispatch; and the crew. Trust the crews when they say something.
Aircraft,After takeoff we were given a series of headings to avoid helicopter traffic which we watched pass left to right. Once clear of the traffic we were climbing and turning towards ACITO the first point on our flight plan approximately 3000 [feet] we got a descent command from an RA. I immediately disconnected the autopilot; put the airplane symbol in the box and reduced power. As soon as I reached the box it went away. The PM (Pilot Monitoring) communicated with Tower [that] we had an RA. They said impossible because there was no aircraft near us. We agreed with them because neither pilot observed any nearby traffic except the helicopter which had passed us. I think we may have had 5G interference. This was a false RA I know now. But I still reacted as [if] it was real. I spoke to Maintenance about it following the flight and they agreed it sounded like the system got interference.Improve the aircraft equipment to distinguish between a false signal and a real RA signal.
Aircraft,I was acting as PIC on flight Aircraft X from ZZZ1 to CLT. The following occurred on DATE at around XA:10 Zulu. We were established on the final for [Runway] 18R into CLT. Between 3000 and 400 ft. we received 3 EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System). COMP MON RA caution messages. They appeared and disappeared in less than 2 seconds. I noticed that during the caution messages the captains side RA was erratic. My First Officer was flying and the autopilot/flight control computer was coupled to his side. During the event; his RA did not show any abnormalities. Because he was flying with no abnormalities on his side and the weather being VMC with light winds we both decided we could safely continue the approach.At 400 feet I pushed the FDR (Flight Data Recorder) event button but did not see an associated green or white message. We landed as normal and when we arrived to the gate I wrote up the discrepancy in the maintenance logbook and contacted maintenance control. I also contacted CLT ground on 121.9 to give them the information that I had for the incident. I also submitted an ACARS report to dispatch with the details of the event.Pilot should maintain situational awareness with onboard systems during the approach phase. Emphasis should be placed on pushing and holding the FDR event button. Most likely a faulty radio altimeter system on the captains side. In my personal opinion I don't believe it was associated with a 5G disturbance.
Human Factors,We had just released the brakes after push back crew was ready and we received clearance from ground for push back when the ground person told us 'the radioactive' material had been boarded.  I had already seen that at XA:45Z we had received the information over ACARS that 'No Dangerous Goods Planned' message; and nobody had informed us of any changes to that or received any messages to show a change.   I then told the person on the headset that we had no information of any Dangerous Goods.  I then told my FO to cancel the push.  We then called operations telling them we had not received any information on any dangerous goods and did not have any paperwork regarding any dangerous goods.  At XC:08Z we received the Final Dangerous Goods Summary.  We then sent messages via ACARS to dispatch and then called dispatch explaining to them what happened and to ask load planning that there was not anything on our final weight manifest indicating any dangerous goods had been boarded.  Since the final weights had come at XB:51Z and the Final Dangerous Goods Summary had come at XC:08Z we figured the final weights did not include the dangerous goods (and as I said before the final weights did not indicate any dangerous goods).At XC:23Z we received the final weights but they still did not indicate dangerous goods.  We sent another message to dispatch to confirm with load planning that the weights included the dangerous goods.  We then received a message from dispatch that they had confirmed with load planning that the dangerous goods were included in the new final weights.  This obviously should not have happened.  I think [location] needs to be reminded of the importance of our procedures regarding dangerous goods.
Aircraft,On departure from ZZZ; climbing through 17;000 ft. with the autopilot on we received an amber ECAM message stating Y Hydraulic SYS OVHT. We noticed the yellow system showed OVHT in amber and the fluid quantity was at the maximum displayed level. I notified ATC at that time that we were dealing with a hydraulic issue and would be returning to ZZZ. I asked for delay vectors which ATC provided me. I continued to fly while my First Officer complied with the ECAM actions; which we both confirmed. ECAM directed us to shut down the Yellow hydraulic pump and the PTU; which we did. My First Officer then went into the QRH for extra malfunction information and to compute our required landing distance. While doing this I notified the Flight Attendants with a quick update on what was happening and that I would get back to them with the full Brief; and I made a PA announcement to the passengers. I then notified Dispatch and Maintenance over ACARS of our malfunction and our intent to return to ZZZ. I also notified Maintenance over the ZZZ Company maintenance frequency to inform them of our return. We got delay vectors while we performed all these actions. Dispatch sent us landing data and agreed with our intent to return to ZZZ. I then formally requested priority handling with ATC and gave souls on board and fuel and our desire to land on Runway XXR since it was the longest runway available and we had lost some spoiler panels and an engine reverser due to the hydraulic system failure. I also asked for the fire trucks to be present in case of any hydraulic fluid leakage or further incident on landing. I then called the flight attendants back and gave the full brief. The flight attendants were calm; cool and collected during this entire situation and performed remarkably. All emergency action items and briefs were complied with and my First Officer and I agreed with our plan to land back at ZZZ. We both discussed the situation and tried to brainstorm if there was anything that we were missing and there was not. We discussed that the ECAM stated if the overheat indication went away we could renegade the yellow hydraulic system. We discussed that if the overheat went away we would reengage the yellow system at 1;000 ft. AGL for the landing. At approximately 12;000 ft. on the descent the overheat indication went out; yet the fluid system level was still at the maximum level. We planned for a longer final approach since our flaps and slats were operating slower than normal. At 1;000 ft. AGL we reengaged the yellow system; as per the ECAM; since the overheat condition no longer existed. I landed the aircraft uneventfully back into ZZZ on Runway XXR with 16;000 ft. available. We were able to clear the runway uneventfully and did not notice any further yellow system hydraulic overheat. We did notice on taxi in that the yellow hydraulic system fluid level was jumping rapidly from the maximum allowed level to the normal fill line; and back and forth. Once at the gate we spoke with Maintenance and informed them of what we had seen and experienced. They then decided to take the airplane to the hangar for more maintenance troubleshooting. I spoke with the passengers on deplaning and everyone seemed in good spirits. I spoke with company personnel and the Chief Pilot. I advised the Chief Pilot that myself and the First Officer were no longer fit to fly and she had scheduling book us on a deadhead back to base. The Chief Pilot a did an excellent job; was very pleasant and helpful and took care of us very well. I was very impressed. My First Officer and I conducted a facilitated debrief and felt that we performed well during this emergency and did everything we could do to ensure a positive outcome. I also spoke with the flight attendants afterwards along with their Supervisor and let them know I appreciated all they did and that they did a good job. I feel everyone performed excellently during this emergency and did everything we could to make it as benign as possible.
Aircraft,On final approach to ZZZ; I was the PF (Pilot Flying) on a visual approach to Runway XXC. Approaching 5 miles; with gear down and approximately 170 kts.; I called for flaps 25 and 30; but the flaps did not move from flaps 15 when the CA (Captain) moved the lever. We accomplished a Normal go-around and I called for flaps 15. After calling for clean maneuvering speed; I called for flaps 5; but the flaps did not move from 15. I reduced power and we set MCP speed below max flap 15 speed. The Captain ran the checklist and we coordinate our plan to land and advised ATC. We landed without incident and had Operations 1 and Fire/rescue look over the plane; then taxied to the gate.I think we handled the emergency well; especially with the all the distractions from ATC; warning horn with gear up and flaps stuck at 15 after go-around; and shifting winds on final.
Aircraft,During descent into ZZZ through about 12;000 ft.; we experienced the entire aircraft shudder aggressively; several display units went dark; the autopilot disengaged; and also a slew of amber EICAS messages displayed. The left engine generator had failed. The Captain called for the QRH and it was run by both our Company pilot jump seaters who are captains. I maintained the radios and backed up the Captain who was hand-flying. The checklist called for one reset of the left GEN CONT switch. When the switch was pressed; the aircraft shuddered again during the power transfer and the generator immediately tripped again. The APU was started and came online to give us a second electrical source. The autopilot was re-engaged and we landed normally on XXL at ZZZ.
Aircraft,At 2500 feet on approach the Captain called for flaps 5. I positioned the flap handle to '5' however the flaps stayed at '1'. No asymmetry. We executed a missed approach and completed the Trailing Edge Flaps Disagree checklist. requested priority handling and landed uneventfully.
Aircraft,While operating above noted flight at 8000 ft. I noticed the left engine had increased to max indicated power on percentage and manifold pressure gauges. The fuel flow indicated 29 GPH. RPM remained at normal cruise of 2100. I retarded the left throttle and was able to return all engine indications to normal cruise power. This was about at the TOD (Top of Descent)  point and I had already been cleared discretion to 4000 ft. I began descent and made a minor increase in the left engine throttle position. There was an immediate loud bang and all engine instruments indicated an engine failure. I performed memory red box items and with the First Officers assistance completed the engine failure checklist. With the engine secured and the prop feathered I requested priority handling with Center. I was cleared direct to the airport and cleared for a visual approach. The destination airport was also the nearest suitable airport and the safest course of action. The landing was uneventful.
Aircraft,Night arrival on the JANNY 5. Outbound after WABBT and level at 5000 ft. MSL as assigned by ATC; received 'Whoop; Whoop; Pull Up' advisory from EGPWS (Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System). As Pilot Flying; initiated response by disconnecting the autopilot; maximum thrust; while pitching nose up while maintaining assigned heading. Advisory quickly went away and leveled at 5200 ft. MSL; notifying ATC. Descended back to 5000 FT and re-engaged the autopilot. No aircraft conflict during maneuver. Noticed [a] hill underneath the aircraft prior to EGPWS activation; but did not present itself as a threat visually. Also noted 'RA' on the MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) presented with terrain pop up during advisory.Wonder if the radio altimeter had malfunctioned due to 5G interference. As mentioned earlier; 'RA' flashed on the MFD with terrain pop up; and the Radio Altimeter varied prior to advisory. Though it was dark; the terrain did not visually present itself as a threat as I was looking outside throughout; and 5000 ft. is a normal vectoring altitude for ATC in that area. The only other possible cause would be closure rate with the terrain; we were flying at about 230 kts. due to traffic behind us. No real suggestion; except to see if 5G interference can trigger spurious EGPWS advisories.
Aircraft,Accepted an aircraft with a deferred aircraft pack and dispatched with one operating pack. While in cruise at FL340; the single operating pack did not maintain a cabin altitude below 10;000 ft. We followed the QRH and descended to 10;000 ft.I tried numerous times to contact Flight Control; but could not get anyone to answer. Next; I tried to contact Flight Control via ARINC; but received no answer. I was able to contact Company and asked them to relay to Company that we were diverting to ZZZ1. We landed without further incident. [I suggest] preventative maintenance. I was told by Maintenance after landing that the aircraft had a massive duct leak.
Procedure,Aircraft X taxiing westbound on Alpha told to hold at Alpha 15 then proceed with left turn to join Bravo. When cleared to proceed (left turn) Aircraft powered up to taxi. Gate ZXX was vacant at time so jet blast blew through to ZXY and blew portable fueling stand into [the] aircraft parked on Gate ZXY. Notified tower manager; ramp manager and AC Maintenance.Suggestion - Main FAA Ground Control needs to inform pilots when making turn off of Inner Alpha taxiway to Bravo (with gates behind them) to use minimum thrust to avoid injury and damage.
Human Factors,USG13 [US limitation of Dangerous Goods] exceeded; too much RPB [IATA code for Toxic substances on passenger flight] was planned. [Total allowed] 85 kgs on a pallet. It is allowed to plan without restriction only on cargo aircraft - UN1654 - Toxic 6.1Cargo department seemed to be completely unaware about the rule and limits. Pallet was offloaded.
Human Factors,I was performing position overlap after just being relieved from FINAL. While I was getting up I observed Aircraft X go around at ZZZ. During the position overlap I observed Aircraft X on vectors with NORTH controller approaching a 050 MVA. Aircraft X was assigned 050 but was still climbing. I observed the NORTH controller turn Aircraft X but not enough to miss the higher MVA. I told the NORTH controller there was a 50-kt tailwind and that he needed to turn Aircraft X away from the MVA. He did not; and then I observed Aircraft X enter the 050 MVA at 043. The NORTH controller eventually turned Aircraft X again but not early enough and Aircraft X entered a 057 MVA at 044. The OS (Operations Supervisor) was very aware of this situation but did not file a MOR.The OS is required to file a MOR; so they should have done so.
Ambiguous,Upon reaching 70 ft. AGL on departure; Windshear Alert activated for about three to five seconds. Captain initiated windshear escape maneuver. Alert disappeared just as suddenly as it appeared. Continued with cutback procedure; once windshear event was over. Suspect that it was due to close proximity of aircraft that had departed just prior to our flight and we were actually encountering a portion of his wake. No adverse control inputs or turbulence was experienced.
Environment - Non Weather Related,On very short final approach to Runway 1L at LAS; Crew noticed several strobe lights off the left side of the aircraft coming from the street adjacent to the airport. Strobes were distracting to the Crew. Crew landed normally. Crew notified Dispatch. Crew notified LAS Tower. There was no further incident. Local events need to be aware of factors that affect aircraft safety in the close proximity of air traffic. Distracting factors for off airport events should be mitigated.
Aircraft,We were scheduled to fly Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1. I refused the aircraft due to the right wing anti ice valve deferred and locked open; with other MEL's adding additional workload on the ground. The required procedures and checklists are extensive for this MEL. We had flown this aircraft the prior day when it had only the wing anti-ice valve deferred. When we got the aircraft on Date; two more MEL's had been added - auto fuel feed system as well as ENG 1 A ignition. After flying the aircraft the previous day; we were familiar with the substantial workload caused by the RT wing anti ice valve deferral. It required multiple checklists and procedures on the ground and initial climb. Adding the ENG ignition deferral and requirement for a manual engine start added additional checklists and procedures to the ground operation; I felt the workload and distractions to normal operations were too great.
Aircraft,We were at cruise and received an ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) caution 'ctr tank 2 fuel lo level' which is normal when the tank runs dry. We waited a few seconds and a second blue ECAM directed us to turn CTR TANK 2 off and open the XFEED; which we did. We pulled up the fuel page and noticed a 1;400 pound imbalance which is also normal. We continued watching the fuel page and noticed the imbalance rapidly getting worse. We consulted the FM to fuel imbalance and followed the procedure; which was to turn tank 1 off; open XFEED and tank 2 should balance out tank one. The fuel imbalance started increasing at a rapid rate. Tank 2 went UP in fuel while tank one was falling rapidly; now approaching 3;000 pounds lower. I called Dispatch and had him connect me with M/C (Maintenance Control). M/C did not have a solution that we had not already tried. Suspecting a fuel leak; we made the decision to divert to ZZZ. I notified the passengers and flight attendants and we diverted to ZZZ. The fuel imbalance continued to get worse and the autopilot eventually had 3.2 degrees of right rudder in with left bank to keep us flying straight and level. We landed ZZZ and requested ARFF assistance to verify we did not have a fuel leak before taxing to the gate.
Procedure,Cargo Safety personnel notified the Cargo Manager that an incorrect shipment was tendered in Flap Retraction Altitude and that the shipment in question contacted 12kgs (approx. 73lbs) of dry ice that was undeclared and not manifested on the DSTG [Departure Staging Guide]. Due to the Cargo Manager status of generalist; the DSTG could not be updated to reflect the dry ice as manifested. The Cargo Help Desk was also contacted by the Cargo Manager; but they reported that they no longer have access to the DSTG to add dangerous goods.Based off the weight of the Dangerous Goods; it does not appear that the change in weight manifest would generate a significant weight change.
Aircraft,The night of Date we took off from ZZZ; Aircraft X to ZZZ1. Passing 9000 feet we got a battery discharge light. We ran QRH which directed us to land at nearest suitable airport. After coordinating with ATC; Dispatch; our crew and passengers; we returned to ZZZ; where we swapped planes and continued to ZZZ1. We did not declare an emergency nor request special handling and treated the situation as a non-emergency maintenance issue requiring RTB (Return To Base).On the initial flight; prior to push; we got an ELEC light; indicating a problem with the standby system. We were also told this was the aircraft's first flight of the day; so it might have come from the maintenance hangar. We called Maintenance and they quickly reset the system and no errors showed. The book was signed off and we departed; only to get the battery discharge after departure.
Human Factors,While departing on the Joker departure from Runway 26R we went above the hold down altitude at Kruger. We did not stop at 11;000 ft. and were notified by ATC at 11;500 ft. ATC immediately issued a higher cleared altitude.Moments earlier we had a substantial wake turbulence encounter from the preceding 737. This was a large distraction. In addition; this was the last leg of a 3 leg day of a 3 day trip. In hindsight; use of the autopilot would have prevented this entirely. Next time on a departure with hold downs I will use the autopilot.
Aircraft,Aircraft X arrived [at] ZZZ with #2 eng inboard t-r sleeve completely missing krueger flap fairing. It was never installed and plugs were in place. See log page for details.
Equipment / Tooling,I'm assigned a tire change on ship Aircraft X on Date (Reference XXXXXXXX). In the process of the tire change we could not get the thread protector on the axle. It appears to be incompatible with the MAX. According to the GSER (Ground Service Equipment Required); 737 wheel wrench kit XX-XXXX-X-XXXX is applicable to both the NG and MAX. Though the wheel nut sockets fit; the thread protector does not. The threads on the protector are too far aft to engage the threads on the axle. MM shows 4 different P/Ns for the thread protector: XXXXXX-XX; -YY; -YY; -ZZ; none of which appear to be bought by the Company. We are attempting to get a thread protector from another carrier.
Procedure,Incorrect documentation due to missing RPB [Toxic Substances IATA code] in the system.In the [company program] system cargo was final (Cargo Final - I). Lir and L/s have been sent with RMD (260kg) and RPB (24kg) on pos 22P (PMC70674R7); PIL (245KG) on pos 11P (PMC48791R7); and ICE (91kg) on pos 12P (PMC64835R7). The flight was departed. After one hour and thirty minutes; [Load control] was informed by the cargo department in ZZZ via phone and also email (screenshots attached); about the issue. The Cargo Agent forgot to put another DG/SL RPB (around 20kg) on the PMC64835R7 pos 12P. As a result; USG 13 was exceeded; and the flight was departed with around 44kg RBP in FWD hold.[Dispatch] was informed via phone about this situation.PIC was informed by [Dispatch].
Human Factors,I cleared Aircraft X for takeoff from Runway XXL. As the aircraft began its departure roll the ASDE-X (Airport Surface Detection Equipment) alert system sounded informing me that there was a vehicle on the runway. I quickly scanned the runway display on the ASDE-X and noticed a target tagged; 'OPS' on the runway moving toward the departing aircraft. I attempted to call the vehicle but received no response. I tried to call the vehicle a second time with an instruction to exit the runway immediately.The vehicle was still moving in the direction of the aircraft but then quickly existed the runway to the left. The Supervisor on Duty received a call from the vehicle operator via the phone line at the watch desk shortly after the incident. The operations personnel who was operating the vehicle apologized for getting on the runway without permission. Vehicle Operators must be trained to always communicate with the Tower before entering any runway surface area.
Procedure,The First Officer asked a question regarding the [Dangerous Goods] form with HAZMAT and we realized that it had not been included on the release. At that time we had already taken off.
Human Factors,While attempting to taxi into DEN gate; we had to [brake] abruptly the aircraft twice for service vehicles passing in front of the aircraft on the service road during night-time hours. At no time did any of the vehicles attempt to slow down; and/or stop. Unfortunately; we did not observe any identifying features on the vehicles other than noting they were baggage carts and catering trucks. We notified the Ramp Tower as well as [Operations] of the situation.
Procedure,Aircraft X had a previous write up and subsequent diversion to ZZZ which was related to 'LG WOW SYS FAIL'. Maintenance performed the necessary repairs while we waited for the airplane to be signed off and released back into service. We were to then ferry the airplane to ZZZ1. After takeoff upon gear retraction; we immediately got the 'LG WOW SYS FAIL' EICAS message. We stopped our climb at 5;000 ft. and requested holding in order to run the QRH procedure. We performed the QRH procedure for 'LG WOW SYS FAIL'; carefully reviewed and applied the special Considerations; and landed without further issue.We deemed requesting priority handling as a necessary safety precaution due to the potential loss of spoilers; reverse thrust; steering capability and priority handling to minimize possibility of go-around as procedure called for a 'gear down' go-around. We requested no further assistance and the steering; stopping and all expectation functionality was effective yielding a safe outcome and no further action required.
Procedure,After departure; since this was the first time I had seen a [Dangerous Goods] form; I asked the Captain about the inclusion of the HAZMAT information on the Flight Release.
Human Factors,I was scheduled to fly from ZZZ to ZZZ1 with Captain. Before the flight we discussed MEL and I verified that the E2 thrust reverser locking pin was in place; but due to a lack of clarity with the MEL; Aircraft X may have flown with both thrust reversers locked. Upon arrival in ZZZ1 I was scheduled to fly a ZZZ2 turn with Captain in the same aircraft. After doing the post flight walk around; I questioned Captain about both thrust reversers being locked and after reviewing the MEL he explained to me that at least one thrust reverser is required for dispatch so we then notified Maintenance Control and Operations.Due to lack of experience with MELs; and the inconspicuous color of the thrust reverser locking pins; Aircraft X may have flown with both thrust reversers locked even though the MEL states that one thrust reverser is required for dispatch.Despite discussing the MEL and the locking pins with both Captains; the thrust reverser locking pins that were installed on the aircraft were recessed from outer surface of the engine and were an inconspicuous color of a plain bolt or pin. Based on my training; I expected the thrust reverse locking pins to be a high visibility color such as red or yellow; however they were not. The incorrect configuration of the aircraft may have been noticed before we flew the aircraft if the thrust reverser locking pins were a highly conspicuous color.
Aircraft,At ZZZ1 I FO (First Officer) completed the walk around and found no issues with the aircraft. During taxi out both me and the Captain did not notice any taxi abnormality nor did I (PF) notice any odd tracking upon takeoff of [Runway] XX in ZZZ1. Flight proceeded to ZZZ without incident. Arriving into ZZZ we were given XYL and descended normally and had a fully stabilized and configured approach at ZZZZZ [intersection]. At 1000 ft. AGL Captain (CA) announced 1000 ft. stabilized and I clicked off the auto pilot. At 40 ft. call out I brought the power to idle and began my flare. Under the 10 ft. call out we ballooned slightly and I felt the main gear touch down normally. However; when the spoilers deployed i felt the aircraft lean to the right as well as track to the right and give a slight side to side motion. Upon touchdown I had also opened the thrust reversers but kept them at idle in order to maintain directional control in case it was asymmetric thrust reverser issues. As I established directional control with the aircraft I immediately thought that the control behavior of the aircraft pointed to a flat tire. I called that out to the CA stating 'I think we blew a tire on the right'. CA took controls as we slowed through 90 knots and pulled off on [taxiway] 1. I asked the tower if they noticed and tire debris and the responded no. It was at this point both me and CA agreed that it was just a single flat tire on the right MLG and elected to taxi to the gate. During our taxi to the gate on Bravo another aircraft behind us noted that we were dragging a tire. We had ground ops verify and they noted that the tires were not flat but that we had a slight crab in our taxi. We pulled into the gate suspecting issues on the right gear but upon inspection I noticed that in fact the LEFT MLG was actually pointed inboard and causing the right MLG to scrub. Also worth noting the LEFT MLG was fully extended and pushing up. Causing a lean to the right.
Human Factors,We were cleared for the River Visual to Runway 19; and I loaded in LDA-Z as a backup. I began to track the fixes on the LDA approach but decided to click off the autopilot and hand fly the River approach. Around 900 [ft.]; we got a ground obstacle warning; but 1) we were still over the river; and 2) using the 300 [ft.]/1NM rule; it seemed like I was on a good descent path. So I turned a little more to the left to avoid the buildings on the right side of the river; but that distracted me enough to where we received a low altitude alert from DCA Tower. My FO (First Officer) said we should have crossed the Rochambeau Bridge at 600 [ft.]; but he said we were between 350 [ft.]-400 [ft.]. I pulled back a bit; but we were still low. I could not see the runway and asked my FO if he saw it. He said he did; and then I got it in sight. Tower also asked us to square the base. This made for a fairly sharp bank angle (20-30 degrees); and I really need to stay further to the right of the bridge so as to make the turn less steep. We still had 4 red PAPIs; which should be a go-around; but I corrected and got some white PAPIs. The landing was smooth and uneventful; but the experience no doubt frightened people on the aircraft.Experience really is the best teacher. I have a very limited number of night time approaches with the River Visual; and I believe that more night flying to Runway 19 will make any pilot feel much more comfortable. Flying the River Visual in the daytime is one thing; flying it at night is much more difficult. I should have been looking for the airport sooner; but I was preoccupied with my descent rate and not getting violated by entering prohibited airspace (which is probably on a lot of pilots' minds). It was also pretty busy and very difficult to see the runway; which exacerbated the situation. But things snowballed with the ground obstacle warning. If I had to do it again; I would have included the airport in my scan (which I didn't do); stayed just a bit higher; and finally I would have started slightly turning right over the George Mason Bridge rather than set too steep of a bank angle at that low of an altitude.
Weather,I was pilot monitoring. First Officer taxied the plane to the deice pad for deicing. When the deice personnel started to deice; they noticed damage to the right wing leading edge outboard slats. Our maintenance personnel inspected the wing and found the damage to be unairworthy and we returned to the gate. After further inspection; ice had been ingested to the #4 engine and dented the N1 fan blade. Maintenance determined that the #4 engine was within limits. There was damage to the outboard and mid span leading edge slats due to FOD. The ground staff informed us that leaving the cargo ramp and as we made our turn; they saw ice chunks flying and knew we would be returning to the gate.Suggestion - There is nothing that we could have done differently. We are all glad that the deicing personnel noticed the damage and brought it to our attention.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,NAV GPS1 FAIL NAV GPS2 FAIL Intermittent failures at XA:12z ; Aircraft X at FL310. GPS 2 self recovered in Flight. GPS 1 recovered after landing. ATC was notified; and position confirmed. ATC informed us that other Aircraft reported similar GPS problems.  IRU's worked normally. Mechanical discrepancy entered in AML.Unknown loss of GPS; IRUs remained operational. And position confirmed with ATC.Unknown loss of GPS. Submitting  for tracking purposes.
Aircraft,I was the pilot monitoring with FO (First Officer) flying. We had the left PACK deferred and before the flight went through the MEL and discussed the procedure we would follow transferring bleeds from APU to engines after takeoff. We noted a very recent flight (possibly the same day) had a PACK high pressure issue under the same circumstances; and agreed to be extra cautious when doing the transfer. Unrelated; but on push back the ground spoilers deployed for some reason. They then retracted at some point leaving the IB ground spoiler fault status message. This caused us to spend about 15 minutes running a fault reset; which was successful. After lift off and at a safe altitude (about 5;000 ft.) as the procedure prescribes; FO decreased the thrust and I transferred the bleeds using the exact procedure from the MEL. (decrease thrust; open right 10th and close the LCV (Load Control Valve) and ISOL (Isolation Valve); etc). The pack initially worked fine; we increased thrust to normal and probably a minute or two later the PACK turned off. It gave no cautions or indications; we could feel the aircraft lose airflow and start to depressurize. At this point we were coming through 9;000 ft. and we asked to level off. We stayed at 9k for about maybe 10 minutes while I attempted to reset the pack. I turned it off and on about 3 times monitoring the ECS (Environmental Control System) page with no luck. At this point we received word from Dispatch to return to ZZZ and we turned around and requested a lower altitude; ending at 4;000 ft. and I performed the unpressurized flight QRH procedure. I informed the passengers and the FA (Flight Attendant) that we would be returning to ZZZ and apologized for the uncomfortable cabin. Closer to the field we determined that we would be close to max landing weight and FO suggested we drop the gear to help burn extra fuel. We then were about to turn final I requested a single 360 to make sure we were within weight. We landed normally and we were given a gate and pulled right in. Faulty PACK with single pack deferred; or faulty RH 10th stage valve.Dispatch of a single PACK airplane with a previous high press write up could/should be avoided. If I would have had more time I would have contacted AIRINC (I was about to call but right then we were ACARSed back for the return) and gotten more information on things I could have tried; such as attempting to bleed from the APU again or retrying the 10th stage valve. However; after feeling and hearing about how uncomfortable the cabin was; and performing the unpressurized procedure to return to ZZZ my focus was on a safe landing back at base.
Aircraft,Gear disagree warning message after retracting gear on takeoff. The two mains were showing up and locked and the nose gear was showing red. ATC gave us a climb to 7;000 ft. which we accepted. We ran the QRH until we got to the point of pulling the gear manual extension handle. We decided to wait on that until we figure out where we were going. Per the QRH we could go no faster than 200 kts. Using the minimum drag speed chart we decided we could fly at 15;000 ft. at that 200 kts. Knowing this we calculated that we could get to ZZZ and still be about 800 lbs. above our reserve fuel level on landing. We sent this info to Dispatch and had them run the fuel burns for those parameters to double check us. They agreed with what we had determined and it was decided we would continue to ZZZ. We did request priority handling and wanted the trucks standing by in case the nose gear did collapse; we also did not know if our nose wheel steering was going to be operative. About 15 minutes prior to landing we completed the QRH checklist and successfully got the gear down and locked with 3 green using the manual release handle. We landed and taxied to the gate with no further issues.
Procedure,After an A319 was cleared for takeoff; we were given a line up and wait clearance on XXL in ZZZ. While waiting for the Airbus to clear the runway I noted that the wind was a light quartering headwind off the right. Approximately 10 seconds after the Airbus rotated we were given a takeoff clearance and began our roll. I noticed that the aircraft accelerated slowly; but within normal 'feel' for a 49;000 lb. takeoff. When I rotated the aircraft felt nose heavy which was consistent with my expectation as we had to load 750 lbs. of ballast to bring the CG within acceptable limits. The rotation was a little faster than what I would normally aim for but still within normal parameters. After I had completed the rotation I observed that I was in the speed bug so approximately V2 + 10 kts.; or approximately 162 kts. According to the FO (First Officer) my maximum pitch attitude was approximately 15-18 degrees. Right as I looked down a t the speed bug I felt a slight airframe buffet followed by the stick shaker. Almost simultaneously I heard the stall warbler and the stick pusher activated; forcing the control column forward and out of my hands. I quickly reached forward to maintain positive aircraft control and held the nose down attitude that the pusher had reached; approximately 5 degrees nose up. The aircraft accelerated to around 185 kts. and I began to slowly raise the nose back up to maintain a positive rate of climb while increasing to maximum thrust. After the stall recovery the climbout was normal although I maintained 190-200 kts until accelerating after flap retraction. We attempted to contact dispatch through ARINC but were not able to copy any radio transmissions due to some sort of issue with ARINC; but we were able to communicate through ZZZ2 Radio to confer with maintenance and the duty pilot to continue to ZZZ1. The rest of the flight was uneventful and we did not notice any control issues or unusual speed tape indications during the approach and landing phase. Unknown cause but potential for weight and balance issue or wake turbulence encounter.
Aircraft,Captain pilot flying; First Officer pilot monitoring. After takeoff the landing gear handle was selected up. We noticed the gear indicated 3 green and 3 red lights. The after takeoff check was completed. The gear indications were still 3 green and 3 red lights. We kept the air speed at 225 kts. and ran the QRH for Landing Disagree. We followed the check list and when the gear handle was placed down the gear lights indicated 3 green lights. The controls were transferred to pilot monitoring. Priority handling was requested and we returned to ZZZ and completed a normal landing.
Aircraft,At flight level F270 in level flight about 25 minutes out of ZZZ; I noticed an amber flame from the bottom of the forward windshield; CA (Captain) side. I immediately recognized the problem and shut off the windshield heats to stop the flame from accelerating. I then noticed a crack appear from the bottom of the windshield and it worked up to about midway to the middle of the windshield. I then transferred the radios to the FO (First Officer) and began to run the QRH: Windshield or Window Cracking; Shattering; Arcing or Delamination checklist. I adjusted the cabin altitude with QRH procedure. As I was adjusting the cabin altitude lower in accordance with the QRH there was a loud alarming sound of the windshield cracking. I looked up and the whole windshield had shattered. Immediately the FO requested priority handling and requested 10;000 ft. and advised the FAs (Flight Attendants) as we both were shocked and not sure if the windscreen would hold and I was in the direct path of the fractured windshield. I continued to manage the cabin altitude and instructed the FO to slow the aircraft to recommended airspeed as I now had to start the QRH back at item XX as the windshield was now shattered. After getting control of the situation I notified the FAs and told them we had everything under control and gave them the [checklist] items. Then notified Dispatch and Maintenance and told ATC we would continue to ZZZ as I felt we had everything was under control and we would not affect the operations of the ZZZ airport. After landing we canceled the emergency and finished the QRH procedure and arrived at our gate. I then called the Chief Pilots and they gave me guidance on what was to be done next
Human Factors,While on visual approach to Runway 19 at TEB we received an altitude alert from Tower Controller. The incident occurred on final approx. 2.5 miles from Runway 19. The First Officer was the Pilot Flying. The Pilot Flying is new to the aircraft and fell behind the aircraft; leading to a below glidepath altitude. Although I did have the airport environment in view my mistake was for trying verbal guidance during the approach. As the Pilot In Command I should have taken the controls immediately instead of verbally trying get the copilot to react on the situation.
Ambiguous,Crew previously requested FL410; but was told to wait due to trailing traffic at F410 that would overtake. On Q69 just past EMCET at FL390 with Jacksonville Center. 10 nm behind a H/B787 at FL410. Directed to climb FL390 to FL410 2 minutes or less for traffic. Aircraft encountered 3-5 seconds of buffeting at 40;500 ft. followed by R wing drop - 45-60 degree wing down. Autopilot disconnected; aircraft stopped climb and deviated from airway. PF (Pilot Flying) initiated recovery. Approximately 100-200 ft. altitude loss.PNF (Pilot Not Flying) monitored recovery; then advised and coordinated with ATC. Turned R 20 degrees to approx 030 for traffic; then resumed climb to FL410 and proceeded direct to RYCKI to resume airways.
Airport,I was working Local control and had an arrival on about a 1/4 mile final. I scanned down the runway and noticed Aircraft X taxiing on Taxiway J and turning left to continue onto Runway 1. I alerted Ground Control to reach out to Aircraft X and have them turn the aircraft back onto Taxiway J before they went onto the runway. Ground Control keyed up and told Aircraft X to turn right immediately to join Taxiway J. Aircraft X immediately turned and did not cross the hold short line for Runway 1.We have had multiple incidents of aircraft inadvertently taxiing out onto Runway 1/19. We have had multiple meetings with Airport Operations to try and remedy this but Airport Operations complains that most of our suggestions are too expensive and they do not want to or cannot spend the money on the ideas we have.We have suggested that they put runway guard lights (wig wag lights) or yellow lights within the painted hold short lines to indicate that the aircraft is approaching a runway. Because of our limited real estate and smaller taxiways; flight crews are mistaking Runway 1/19 for Taxiway J. This is happening on a very consistent basis. We have had approximately 5 runway incursions or ALMOST incursions over the past few months just like this incident.This is a very serious safety matter at DCA that must be addressed as soon as possible before something catastrophic happens.
Aircraft,We were still in our climb to 41;000 ft. when we got a Master Caution; HYD indication and an A System Engine Driven Pump Low Pressure light illuminated. We verified what indication we had and I called for the QRH Checklist. After we completed that; I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to let them and Maintenance know our issue. As we continued we did notice a decrease in the A System quantity; but the pressure remained steady. Around 40 minutes later; the B System Engine Driven pump Low Pressure light also illuminated. I called for and we ran the same checklist for the Low Pressure light. We continued to have normal system pressure on the hydraulic pressure gauges so we decided to continue the flight. I instructed the First Officer to send another ACARS message to Dispatch; which he did.At this point; we ran through some possible scenarios and began to prepare for an A System failure. We input data for a normal and A System failure landing into the Weight and Balance. Then we discussed what might happen; once we started to put a higher load on the hydraulic system; such as lowering the gear and flaps; using thrust reverse and nose wheel steering. It became apparent to us that while we were operating normally; our situation could change rapidly. It was at this point we decided to advise ATC and proceed directly to ZZZ. We notified ATC of our hydraulic malfunction and our intention to go directly to our destination. I then asked the First Officer to notify Dispatch of our request for priority handling. He did via ACARS. I contacted the Flight Attendants and briefed them on what we planned to be a normal landing; but that we had requested priority handling and to expect to see the CFR vehicles near the runway.I also briefed the Passengers about the same situation. ATC cleared us direct to the airport and we started our descent. During the Approach Briefing; we had discussed configuring early to allow time for the electric pump gear and flap extension. Those worked as expected and we maintained normal pressure on the hydraulic gauges. The landing was normal. Thrust reverse and spoiler extension operated normally with the slightest of flicker from the Electric Pump Low Pressure lights as mentioned in the QRH. I even had normal nose wheel steering. We cleared the runway and I asked that CFR inspect the aircraft for any visible leaks. They saw none; so we continued to the gate in ZZZ. Upon arrival at the gate; I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. I then wrote up the Two Low Pressure light indications in the logbook.
Ambiguous,On visual approach to Runway 26L at LAS doing a Heads-up Guidance System practice approach/landing at 400 ft. AGL [and] got the 'No Flare' Alert in Heads-up Display to landing. No other indications on Heads-up Display or First Officer AIII panel. Continued approach/landing since it was a visual approach and everything else was normal. Contacted Dispatch and Chief Pilot upon arrival at gate. Was asked to complete reports. Possible 5G RA interference.
Procedure,I was informed by company I may have flown an aircraft that was wrongly configured by maintenance for a thrust reverser MEL. MEL maintenance procedures not correctly complied with. Review MEL item more closely; pilots and maintenance alike.
Procedure,We may have flown Aircraft X with both locking pins in the thrust reversers. After reading the associated MELs it seemed like everything was in order.Maintenance may have made an error in responding to the appropriate MEL action.Make MELs more understanding and easy to read. Make the locking pins easier to see to the human eye.
Aircraft,At V1; the Captain (Pilot Monitoring) noticed the #1 engine was surging between approximately 1.35 to 1.5 EPR. After raising the gear; he pointed out the engine issue; and we elected to continue the climb while monitoring the engine for further indications of the issue. The engine continued to surge during the climb; with both the N1; EGT; and engine noise seeming to correspond with the surging engine. Upon reaching thrust-reduction altitude; we reduced the power to the CLIMB setting; which seemed to have minimal effect on the surge. The Captain coordinated with ATC that we wanted to continue the climb to our assigned altitude; but might need to return to ZZZ to land due to an engine issue. We continued our climb to 5;000 MSL; and as the engine power reduced to maintain 230 kts.; the surging seemed to subside. We concluded that the surging seemed to coincide with higher power settings; and continuing the climb to cruising altitude and on to ZZZ1 didn't seem prudent. The Captain coordinated with ATC for the return to ZZZ; informed the passengers of the issue and that we would be returning to base; and we set up for the RNAV to XXC. The approach and landing were uneventful.Unsure of the causal factors of why the engine would surge; but it seemed to be related to the higher power settings.
Aircraft,After a normal taxi out and departure from ZZZ we were given a climb to 10;000 feet by ZZZ departure control. ZZZ then handed us off to Center and we were given a climb to FL240. Shortly after beginning the climb out of 10;000 feet we received a call from the #1 flight attendant stating they were getting a strong; musty odor in the aft section of the cabin. I told the flight attendant we would begin our procedures for fumes and asked them to let me know if there is any worsening or improvement of the smell. I ended the call and told the FO (First Officer) who was also the PF (Pilot Flying) what the situation was. I assigned PF and radio duties to the FO and began the immediate action items on the QRC. I also instructed the FO to request a level off and prepare ATC for a diversion. After following the QRH guidance I contacted the flight attendants to get an update on the fumes in the cabin. I was told that the fumes had not subsided and could be smelled throughout the entire cabin. I was also informed that portable oxygen bottles were being used by flight attendants in the rear of the aircraft. At this point I instructed the FO to [request priority]; and let ATC know we would likely be diverting into ZZZ1. Then I contacted our Dispatcher via the crew phone app and quickly summarized our situation. I asked for assistance in determining the best diversion airport and we quickly agreed on ZZZ1 based on the current weather and our proximity at that time. After contacting dispatch I informed the flight attendants that we are diverting to ZZZ1 and would be on the ground in 15-20 mins. I asked if the fumes had diminished and was told there was no difference; and some of the flight attendants had temporarily moved toward the forward cabin area to escape the strongest odor. At this point I elected to complete the Smoke/Fumes removal procedure. After completing this process I again asked the flight attendants about the level of fumes in the cabin and they stated that they were diminishing. Even though the fumes were beginning to subside; I still believed the safest course of action was to land; even though we would be overweight. During the time frame when I was consumed with QRH procedures and communications with dispatch and the flight attendants; the FO was managing the aircraft's flight path and loading the approach procedure for runway XXL at ZZZ1. We completed the Non-Routine landing and overweight landing checklists and a landing performance assessment. The first officer briefed the approach and I elected to have him fly the approach and landing. I asked ATC to advise ARFF (Air Rescue Firefighting) of our overweight landing so we could have a brake and tire inspection after arrival. The First Officer flew a perfect approach with a very soft touchdown at a vertical speed of less than 100 FPM. After rollout and deceleration we transferred control; and I was able to taxi clear of the runway. ARFF made a brief inspection of our wheels and brakes and did not note any damage of excessive temperatures. We taxied to the gate and prepared to deplane the passengers. At the gate our flight was boarded by members of ARFF; and they would not let anyone leave the aircraft until they collected air samples. Once the air samples were collected and determined to be safe; they allowed all passengers to deplane. When the aircraft was completely deplaned the flight attendants informed me that they were not feeling well and wanted medical attention. They were transferred to a local medical treatment facility and later released. I made the appropriate logbook entries; contacted dispatch; and filled out a fumes event form.Time compression coupled with complex QRH procedures significantly increased the workload during this event. SOP's greatly aided in safe outcome of this event. This was the first trip and first leg the FO and I had ever flown together; and strong SOP compliance allowed us to complete every required task effectively. I don't know what occurred mechanically with the aircraft to cause the fumes; so it is difficult to suggest any preventative measures.
Aircraft,During cruise flight; ELAC [Elevator Aileron Computer System] 1 and 2 failed over [Location]. I was a dead heading pilot sitting in [seat] X. I was called to the cockpit by the Captain whom I flew with during the course of this 4 day trip. In addition; I was PM (Pilot Monitoring) on Aircraft X; ZZZ-ZZZZ. I have flown the Airbus [for many years] for various carriers. In addition [to] being a Line Pilot; Captain and First Officer; I have also been an instructor [for] Airbus.  The Captain felt that I could be of use to his very well qualified crew as a third member in the cockpit. Let me be clear to say that the First Officer; the PF (Pilot Flying); was a former [other Airline] pilot who had thousands of hours of experience. The Captain had well over 5;000 hours in the seat. My role in the event was support alone. When the FA (Flight Attendant) came back to inform me that the Captain requested my presence in the flight deck; I knew what that meant. I grabbed my IPad and proceeded to the cockpit. Once inside; the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) told me everything system wise and the PFD indicated that the crew was in Alternate Law. The FO (First Officer) was hand flying the aircraft and we were at FL260. I took my place in the jump seat and asked how I could be of assistance. The Captain passed the radio comms to me while the FO flew. It's one thing to fly around at 5;000 ft. while demonstrating Alternate Law and it's quite another to be fully immersed in an aircraft that is making uncommanded movements via pitch; be in turbulence at FL260; all while speaking with ZZZZ Air Traffic Controllers. The PF was doing a great job. I took Com 1. The Captain was trying the [to] contact Dispatch/Maintenance control via the crew phone but was having trouble with 2 way cutting out. I went to the FOM and provided him with ARINC (Commercial Radio) freq to call ZZZ1 radio. While he was doing that; I was speaking with ATC; coordinating descent and making inputs to the FCU (Fuel Control Unit). Again; the FO was very actively flying the aircraft and doing a great job. I then focused on systems. The overhead indications were 'lights out' which ordinarily would mean the flight control computers were working. Except the ECAM said they weren't. I then pushed the F/CTL page and all indications were green. Again; would look normal. Except something was happening because clearly we were in alternate law. I researched QRH for a reset but it was for On Ground Only. There was no reset. I then looked in Comply AOM for information. I also referenced the QRH within Comply. The Captain was very busy; the FO was busy flying; I am doing the radios and referencing manuals. In addition; my role is simply support so at appropriate times I informed the CA (Captain)/FO about what they had systems wise and what was going to happen systems and performance wise when we degraded to Direct law. Referred to the NNP (Non Normal Performance) pages of QRH; did their landing distance computation; and also reminded the crew that when determining Vapp to make corrections off of flaps full speed before selecting flaps 3. Captain requested backup for non routine landing considerations. At all times he was in command and my role was to have the appropriate manuals out and ready for when he requested. This crew was also dealing with the normal communication issues facing every crew on every flight. Task saturation; communication barriers; airspace closures related to military airspace requiring the crew to NOT be able to proceed directly to the divert airport; dark and turbulent versus dark and stormy; communication barriers with ATC; and balancing the need to follow the ECAM with the need to reference other manuals. In addition; at least 2 times the cockpit crew was interrupted by communication not from the number 1 FA (Flight Attendant) but from the rear flight attendants. They meant well but their concerns weren't relevant and not helpful.  This crew did a great jobmanaging the serious issues and I was happy to assist. On final I did suggest configuring to flaps 3; on speed; before gear down command since the plane would be trimmed already making it easier on the FO to fly. He did a great job.Please put the ARINC freq map back in the QRH. Please tab the QRH although I tab mine myself.
Aircraft,During descent received level one ENG 3 FADEC MAINT alert. Engine was running properly; referred to QRH. No crew action required. Then; while continuing the arrival in low 20's or high teens; received Level Two ENG 3 RPM LOW alert. #3 Rpm was low and EGT higher than 1 and 2. Referred to QRH and complied with the checklist. We were unable to get the engine to run properly even below 10;000 ft. Eventually the GEN 3 OFF alert came on. We elected to [request priority handling] and shut the engine down. Performed a flaps 35 engine inoperative auto land. We informed ground that we did not need assistance; and they allowed us to taxi to the ramp.
Aircraft,On approach going flaps 25 left hydraulic Press light. Did go around and [requested priority handling]. Ran QRH and contacted Dispatch. We setup for the longest Runway and landed Runway XX to a complete stop. Had to towed be towed into the ramp. Called Duty Officer To info him of the event. Accomplished all tasks in regulations.
Aircraft,B FA (Flight Attendant) was called by our Captain before takeoff and told that there was a loud noise written in the log book; but the door seal had been checked and was fine. When I got to the aft galley after taking drink orders; above 10;000 ft.; it was VERY loud back there. I walked from door to door; but the sound seemed more like it was coming from the ceiling of the galley; not a door.While walking back to the aft galley from serving my first tray of drinks; I felt the right side of my head fill with pressure. It went all the way down into my lower right jaw. That is not normal for me during flying. I called the Captain then; and said; 'There is really something going on back here; the pressurization is hurting my head all the way into my jaw.' He said they would handle it in ZZZ. I also said; 'We don't feel safe or comfortable taking this plane back up again.' He said they would take care of it in ZZZ. That's the last we heard from or saw of him.Name was not doing well at all. She seemed disoriented and one of her eyes was bright red. I started feeling very irritable out of nowhere. One passenger came back to aft lav and vomited. Other passengers were pulling on their ears.After landing; a Mechanic came on and we tried to relay all of our information to him. We went out in the jet way; and spoke with our new set of pilots. I asked if we could give Name some O2 from the cockpit because she was having signs of hypoxia. They set her up with the O2 mask; and for several minutes she took oxygen.They told me my face and eyes were very swollen; I kept continuously trying to clear my head by holding my nose closed and blowing. It wasn't working; and my head was hurting very badly. At one point our new Captain called for EMT to come take a look at us.My blood pressure was 193 over 100 and something! I was feeling really loopy and goofy. A ZZZ supervisor came down while the EMT were there. Someone made the decision to take us to see a doctor at a hospital.The diagnosis was altitude sickness. My blood pressure was still very high; but coming down. We stayed overnight in ZZZ. Our 2 day trip turned into a 3 day trip.When flying back the next day; my head was making a lot of internal crackling noises. It seemed that the air had been trapped all that time- overnight. I was told by the ZZZ1 inflight department that if I wanted to get paid for the overnight and also the two flights home; then I would need to grieve it through the Union.You can imagine my disappointment. [A Manager] checked on us; but no one from ZZZ1 inflight ever did.
Aircraft,Upon descent after sterile was indicated all flight attendants prepared the cabin for landing. When finished we all took our seats. At that time I began to smell a very overwhelming scent that smelled of dirty socks and locker rooms. The passengers around my jumpseat started to look around and question the origin of the smell. At the moment I walked to the back of the aircraft to speak with the number 2 flight attendant. He agreed that the smell was present and overwhelming. We both started to feel light headed and I felt nauseous and got a headache as well. The other two flight attendants didn't smell anything but they were at the forward part of the aircraft. When we landed the number 2 fa called the captain and told him of the events.The captain told us ' it's just one of those old packs' and dismissed our concerns.Have procedures in place for fume events!
Human Factors,I took position and was briefed that there was a vehicle on the runway. Aircraft X called up about 10 minutes or so after I had taken position; and I cleared him to land. I completely forgot about the vehicle on the runway; even though the red 'vehicle' strip was in front of me. As Aircraft X was on short final; I scanned the runway one final time; and noticed the vehicle was still on the runway. As Aircraft X was starting to flare; I sent him around. He made left closed traffic and landed without incident.  I don't think any recommendations are necessary to prevent re-occurrence. From a personal standpoint; I have to reevaluate myself and what caused me to become complacent. I've seen these situations happen to Controllers I work close to; in briefings; and recurrent training. I always ask myself; how does that kind of thing happen?? It doesn't make any sense; and then it happens to me. It's a matter of remembering that I can't ever relax or get distracted. I must stay engaged.
Procedure,Aircraft X was inbound to SAN from the northwest. A cold front was moving through the airspace producing mid level cloud cover throughout San Diego County. Instrument approaches were in required. As Aircraft X was approaching LUCKI; the Controller issued a southbound turn and descent to 5;000 ft. This was to build some space between the arrival ahead. Once the space was adequate; the Controller turned the aircraft towards VYDDA. I had taken a phone call from RNM informing me they were closing. After taking that phone call; I noticed Aircraft X was descending below 5;000 ft. I alerted the SDWR controller (West Radar) position of the situation and the controller responded with 'Ya I cleared him' I instructed the Controller to issue a Low Altitude Alert and the Controller said 'He's almost out of it'. No action was taken by the Controller and Aircraft X landed WOI (Without Incident]).My main concern is the Controller's actions to this event. His responses to me after alerting him to this situation and not issuing the low altitude alert concern me. Traffic was very light throughout the shift and time on position was not an issue. The Controller simply needed to comply with my direction and take action to correct the error. If the Controller had time to tell me 'He's almost out of it'; and 'Ya I cleared him; the Controller had time to issue the low altitude alert and correct the error.
Aircraft,My Captain and I were to fly four legs in the same aircraft; but after the first leg from ZZZ to ZZZ1 we were switched to a -700 that had just been released from Maintenance. They had replaced the #1 engine driven hydraulic pump and supply line. The preceding crew also wrote up the #2 B system engine driven hydraulic low pressure light illumination; which Maintenance Operations checked and could not duplicate. Start up through take off were normal. When the Captain raised the gear after takeoff; he noticed a Master Caution FLT CONT light flicker on; then immediately off. At a safer altitude; we both looked around more and found no abnormal indications; so we continued the departure to ZZZ2. In cruise at FL 400; the #1 engine driven hydraulic low pressure light illuminated. The QRH led us to turn off that pump. Both hydraulic systems showed normal pressure and quantity at that point; so we continued to ZZZ2.During the descent with throttles at idle; the #1 oil filter bypass light illuminated. This time the QRH directed a #1 engine shutdown. We transferred aircraft control to the Captain; [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Approach; requested and received extra vectors for time from Approach; completed the QRH Checklist for engine shutdown and single engine landing; and landed flaps 15. Landing and taxi to the gate were otherwise normal. By the time we set the parking brake at the gate; #1 hydraulic quantity; as I recall; showed 37% RF (Re Fill). On post flight walk around; a hydraulic fluid leak from the #1 engine was obvious; and the ground crew had placed a catch box with litter under the leak. Both oil quantities read 100% at post flight.
Ambiguous,Radio altimeters failed on final to Runway 27 [at] IAH at approximately 1;100 MSL. This lasted about 5-10 seconds.
Aircraft,Climbing through FL315 both RUDDER SYS 1-2 INOP; and AUTOPILOT FAIL messages appeared and the autopilot disconnected. I took controls immediately and leveled at FL320. I told my First Officer to open the Quick Reference Handbook and run the Autopilot fail checklist then the rudder checklist. The rudder checklist did not solve the problem. The messages persisted. I gave the First Officer the flight controls next and asked ATC to descend us out of RVSM airspace. He descended us to FL280. When at FL280 the RUDDER SYS 1-2 INOP message went away. Then RUDDER SYS 1 INOP and RUDDER SYS 2 INOP went on and off and alternated roughly 5 or 6 times. After that the RUDDER SYS 1-2 INOP came back steady. Then the YAW DAMPER FAIL message appeared. I noticed we were approximately 20 miles southeast of ZZZ2. I knew there were Company operations and maintenance there. I told my Flight Attendant to lock up and sit down and I would advise her of the situation in a little while. I sent a message to dispatch of the messages; discussing declaring; and diverting to ZZZ2. He spoke with maintenance and we all agreed for me to request priority handling. I promptly requested priority handling with ZZZ. We got a diversion started and ATC descended us and vectored us to ZZZ2. In the descent around FL180 the RUDDER SYS 1-2 INOP message disappeared. Both AUTOPILOT FAIL and YAW DAMPER FAIL messages persisted. We got through about 12000 ft. at which point we were caught up and finished getting the plane ready for landing. I called the Flight Attendant and informed her of what was happening and did the TEST report. After which I communicated with the passengers of the diversion. They vectored us to left downwind of XXR; at which point I took back flight controls. We landed with no issue. Fire trucks surrounded us and then ATC asked us if we needed their help; to which we informed them no. We parked at the gate. Got a number for ATC. Talked with the fire department; duty manager; maintenance control; and scheduling. People were put into the terminal. I was informed they would go out on the next repo flight. We went to the hotel.
Aircraft,During takeoff; we had both master cautions come on with all lights illuminated on the Captain's and First Officers six packs. I rejected the takeoff because I thought it was the safest thing to do. Never before have I ever seen all lights illuminated on the Captain's and First Officer's six packs during takeoff. I would do the same things based on the indications we had on takeoff.
Aircraft,Received a level 1 'Engine 3 FADEC Maint' alert followed by a level 1 'Engine 3 RPM lo ' alert. Followed Quick Reference Handbook procedure.  Performed an engine restart in flight followed by an engine shutdown in flight. Notified  ATC of engine shutdown and performed engine out auto land. Engine failure.
Human Factors,The plane was en-route to LAX from ZZZ when the Captain realized the Aircraft X 5G NOTAM is no longer in the release for landing at LAX. Once we leveled off at cruise; both pilots checked and weren't 100% certain if we can shoot the CAT II approach into LAX due to low visibility and the 5G NOTAM for Aircraft X not being on the release (The Aircraft Y 5G NOTAM was on the release). The Captain proceeded to message dispatch to get a clarification on the 5G NOTAM and was told that we won't be able to do CAT II. At this point; we were getting close to the ZZZ1 VOR and the Captain (being the Pilot Monitoring (PM)) informed ATC that we will not be able to do a CAT II approach. Due to low visibility at LAX; ATC gave us an expected holding instruction at ZZZ1 VOR on the 150 radial 10 mile leg. The Captain read back the holding instruction as told by ATC and was not told that his read back was correct or not. We proceeded to input the hold into our FMS and both pilots verified that it is correct before activating. While all of this is happening; we were still flying on a heading assigned by ATC and eventually cleared direct to ZZZ1. As we got close to ZZZ1 VOR to begin our hold; ATC informed us that we should of been holding 10 miles from ZZZ1 VOR fix and not a 10 mile leg at ZZZ1 VOR. At this point; the Captain requested a vector to rejoin the hold and ATC instructed us to turn left. We rejoined the hold without any issues and did about one turn in the hold. We then were told by ATC that RVR was 6;500 feet at LAX which allowed us to do our CAT I approach. We then proceeded to LAX with vectors from ATC and landed safely.The cause of this event was a miscommunication between the flight crew and ATC. The flight crew expected to hold at the ZZZ1 VOR with a 10 mile leg while ATC was instructing us to hold 10 miles from the VOR. Another contributing factor was the super short flight from ZZZ to LAX; which lead the flight crew to have to scrambled to get all the information very quickly (Landing data; figuring out the 5G NOTAM; Arrival Gate; ATIS;) all while having to figure out a holding clearance.I would suggest that the flight crew should of double check with ATC and not assumed that the read back was correct when ATC did not respond back the first time. The holding instruction was somewhat uncommon for both captain and I because ATC will usually give a holding clearance at a FIX and not miles off from the fix.
Aircraft,After takeoff; during climb; the First Officer noted an odor that he thought might be coming from the forward lavatory. Within a few minutes; the #1 Flight Attendant called. She stated that there was a 'dirty sock' smell in the cabin and that it was 'strong' predominantly in the aft cabin. I asked if the odor was continuing and if it was causing irritation to anyone's eyes; nose or throat. She stated that it seemed to be dissipating and that nobody was feeling any irritation. I called for an update one more time during climb with continued improvement of conditions. Once at cruise; I spoke with the #1 Flight Attendant again and she told me that the smell had abated and everyone was fine. I made a Satcom call to Dispatch and was patched through to Maintenance. I told them of the situation and that I was putting it in the logbook along with an Airbus Cabin Odor Report. The flight continued with no further odor noted in the cabin or in the flight deck. During descent into ZZZ; the #1 called and stated that the odor had returned; although not as bad as before. We did note a light 'dirty sock' odor in the cockpit as well. We landed without incident and had the Station Manager notify contract maintenance.
Aircraft,I was assigned to a 4-day pairing with a XB:00 report time on Date. I met with the First Officer (whom was receiving IOE training) at the gate around approximately XA:00. We spent some time to discuss the pairing and to see if I could answer any questions that he may have. The weather forecast on the east coast was looking good; our aircraft was on time; and we were looking forward to working together. This was the First Officer's 3rd leg of IOE; it was our first time working together. We discussed dividing Pilot Monitoring/Pilot Flying duties and determined that he would operate as Pilot Flying on Aircraft X from ZZZ1 to ZZZ; I would operate as Pilot Flying on the 2nd leg from ZZZ to ZZZ2; and he would operate the last leg of the day as Pilot Flying from ZZZ2 to ZZZ3. Shortly after; I performed the walk around inspection of Aircraft X in ZZZ1. During the walk around inspection I noted that there had been some peeling paint in the RVSM areas; however this had already been documented in the Non Essential for Flight of the aircraft logbook. At this time I had also coordinated with the ground crew that our Towing Indication Light was currently on an MEL (XX-XX-XX). Further; since catering had left; I also verified that the aft aircraft door 2L was closed as per our MEL (YY-YY-YYB). There were no other abnormalities noted during my walk around inspection. We completed our preflight tasks and checklists; followed by an on time and normal push. We then performed a SETWA (Single Engine Taxi Without APU) taxi to Runway XXL. During the taxi; the aircraft felt heavy; but seemed consistent with what you would normally experience having 80 versus 20 customers onboard. Our take-off roll was normal with approximately 10 kts. of left-to-right crosswind; our landing gear also retracted as normal. The flight was normal. Prior to arrival into ZZZ airspace; we discussed that we would perform a Flaps Full landing to fulfill one of his IOE tasks. The ILS was out of service to Runway YY in ZZZ; the First Officer set up for the ZZZZZ Charted Visual Approach to be backed up with the FMS to a Flaps Full landing with medium auto braking selected.After a successful arrival and transition to the visual approach; the First Officer disengaged the autopilot and hand flew a stable approach to Runway YY. Tower had asked us if we could land on Runway ZZ; however since it was a last minute change that hadn't been previously discussed in detail; we elected it would be safer to stay on Runway YY. When he landed; he was on center line; in the touchdown zone at a normal vertical rate; without a side load. The first officer had previously selected medium auto brakes and had begun his manual braking. I had my feet on the brakes with him as I normally would. As we began to decelerate I did briefly feel something unusual on the left brake. The feeling was as if the brake lost pressure for a second. Tower asked us to use minimal time on the Runway. We exited the Runway at taxiway 1. Ground instructed us to cut across the black top and go straight to gate XX. The airplane seemed to be taxiing as normal until we entered the ramp area. As we slowed to pull onto the gate's taxi line; the aircraft felt as if we were going up a slope. I used extreme caution to avoid using too much thrust and made sure the buffer zone was clear. I did make a comment to the First Officer that I felt we were not lined up on the center line; but continued to follow the marshal's instructions. We safely shut down both engines and performed the Shut Down Checklist. I said goodbye to our customers during the deplaning process and proceeded to secure the aircraft so that we could all step off to use the facilities and get dinner. I also took a moment to call the kids before they went to bed and told them I love them. I was first to arrive back to the aircraft and begun preparing for the next flight to ZZZ2. As I was sitting there; I was thinking about some of the small things from the previous flight. The hydraulic pressures were good; the quantities were normal. I decided to stop what I was doing and preform the exterior walk around.As soon as I saw the Right Main Landing Gear; I immediately knew something was wrong. I checked the wheels and they appeared to be stressed. When I got to the left side of the aircraft the Left Main Landing Gear was pointing about 15 degrees left of what it should be. On the front of the assembly; the shimmy damper was missing some bolts and completely out of its housing. There was also evidence that this caused tire damage to both tires. I went up to the flight deck and called MX. I made a logbook entry and the aircraft was removed from service. We were very surprised that to see the damage in ZZZ especially since the landing was consistent with most other Flaps Full landings I have experienced. We had another pilot who was traveling with us to ZZZ2 on both flights; even he was surprised. We asked our cabin crew if it felt out of the ordinary and they both said no as well. Not a single customer made a comment as I was saying good bye. It was then noticed that our Left Main Landing Gear was not centered just prior to touch down.
Ambiguous,Flying enroute over Pacific Ocean; we heard other aircraft talking about a balloon sighting on a very frequently travelled aeronautical track from US mainland west coast to Hawaii. My First Officer sighted the balloon when it was over 10 miles away. This was computed using our TAS and a clock. To see this balloon at 10 miles distance; and be able to ascertain that there was some type of equipment apparatus suspended closely underneath; we estimated the size to be somewhere between a corporate jet and a 737 aircraft. We flew directly underneath the balloon; and as we were at FL380 at the time; we estimated the balloon was around 45;000 ft. in altitude. I notified both Dispatch and SFO ARINC of the sighting with exact position; time; and estimated altitude. It is my opinion that were an aircraft to collide with this object; the result would be a fatal hull loss.
Aircraft,Captain [was] Pilot Flying and First Officer [was] Pilot Monitoring. Takeoff roll on Runway XXL was uneventful. On climb out; Pilot Monitoring noticed the autothrottle (A/T) disengaged and re-engaged it. It happened a second time with the same results. The number 2 engine had trouble exactly matching the commanded climb thrust. I also reengaged the A/T at least once. After engaging the autopilot around 5-6;000 ft. MSL; Pilot Flying noticed excess yaw and roll and disengaged autopilot. Both pilots noticed the number 2 engine was at approximately 60 percent N1 with a white arc showing commanded vs actual position. There were no other engine indications or abnormalities. The crew accomplished Immediate Action Items for the 'Engine Limit or Surge or Stall' checklist. Pilot Monitoring requested an intermediate level off at 10;000 ft. and continued course. Captain gave First Officer radios and Pilot Flying duties shortly after leveling of at 10;000 ft.After the turn at ZZZZZ on the ZZZZZ2; ZZZZZ1 SID; ATC gave vectors to remain in the local area. Aircraft was at 10;000 ft. MSL; 230 KIAS near location west of ZZZ. The crew ran the remainder of Quick Reference Handbook for 'Engine Limit or Surge or Stall' checklist and coordinated with local Maintenance and Maintenance Control/Dispatch; notified passengers and FM. Requesting priority handling by ATC and crew simultaneously when 20-25 minutes into flight the engine rolled back and failed. Crew ran the 'Engine Failure or Shutdown' checklist and the 'One Engine Inoperative Landing' checklist. Crew planned and executed an overweight; single engine; return to ZZZ. To land below max landing weight we would have needed to fly for roughly 2 more hours. A planned overweight visual approach to Runway YYL via vectors to a 10-mile final with 15-flaps was uneventful with a smooth landing. Crew taxied to Gate XX and shut down the remaining engine to wait for baggage/pallet carts to be moved and then tow-in.No sooner than we had parked; Crew Scheduling called me; notifying us that we would be leaving in roughly 65 minutes to ZZZ1. We decided that we needed to re-evaluate our fitness for duty and needed to speak to Union representation before proceeding any further. We then spoke to Maintenance Control over the phone and then hub maintenance at the aircraft to discuss the events. We had noticed that the Fuel Pump Package had been replaced that morning with an engine run accomplished. The number 2 HMU; Heat Exchanger and Fuel Pump were replaced following the engine failure in flight. A member of the Chief Pilot's office; and later the Chief Pilot; met us at the aircraft to check on us; coordinate with Company (scheduling; Chief Pilot; etc) and accomplish a [safety evaluation]. We reached a mutual conclusion it was not in the best interests of safety to fly as we were still processing the chain of events during the flight and the associated stress/workload.We accomplished a thorough debrief and reconstruction of the flight. Preflight: Both of us woke early due to the nature of the schedule. It was day 2 of the 4-day pairing; with an early show ZZZ2-ZZZ3 on day 1. Originally scheduled to fly ZZZ3-ZZZ; the pairing had been changed to a deadhead due to equipment substitution. The evening was relaxing and we were both asleep early. I slept from XA:00 pm until XJ:30am. In the morning I had a very long hold time with the Company's Agent on Demand before van pickup time at XM:02 AM. The flight plan was released while I was getting ready for the van ride. I knew we had a longer van ride; so I did not expect this to be a problem. We left the hotel on time and reviewed the flight plan en route. We were scheduled for a random southerly route ZZZ-ZZZ1 at FL300 due to significant impacts from turbulence and convective activity/SIGMETS; increasing the complexity. The Dispatcher had asked the Captain to call regarding this flight; which I did during the van ride. We both had significant distractions with thefunctioning of the weather app on our EFBs (this is an ongoing issue where it attempts to connect and then drops connectivity).On arriving at the airport; we had the additional task of [Covid procedures]. I went to the mission planning area while the First Officer went to the aircraft to begin the preflight to save time. The 45-minute report time was compressed; especially with the additional attention to weather/turbulence and verifying the random route points. Fortunately; we departed Gate XY; close to the satellite mission planning room; saving some time. There was some pressure from the Gate Agents for us to leave and then the ramp personnel were waiting for us to push. I used CRM and our company process approach to ensure everything was ready to go before releasing brakes. Taxi: We planned Runway ZZR for departure; and Ground Control changed us to ZZL. I called for the runway change procedure and we were split-task for a few minutes to update the required information. The remainder of the taxi out was uneventful.
Aircraft,[Our flight] from ZZZ-ZZZ1 had a MEL for the right FMC. It was inoperative but not collared or required to be per the MEL. The flight was uneventful and normal until about 80 miles west of ZZZ2. The left FMC then failed; the auto-throttles failed; VNAV went to Altitude Hold; and the Autopilot went into CWS Roll mode. ATC was notified we had a dual FMC failure losing all long range NAV and we requested radar vectors until further notified. The ATC request was granted. First Officer was great at making suggestions for our situation and recommended we requested priority handling to see if the other FMC still worked. First Officer and I considered our options and we made a plan. Our workload was increased and we had lost our normal mode of navigation so we [requested priority handling]. We consulted the Quick Reference Handbook; but considered the fact that the MEL effectively prevented us from potentially using the other FMC if it did work due to the restriction to not move the switch from the operative side for all 'phases of flight'. The Quick Reference Handbook also did not consider the fact we had a MEL. In light of our situation; and priority handling; I decided to use my Captains authority to see if the right FMC was working normally. The FMC source select switch was placed to normal and it was confirmed the right FMC worked normally and then the switch was placed to both on the right FMC. The rest of the flight was uneventful. The [priority landing] was continued all the way to the gate since we had to deviate from the MEL using [the] Captains authority. The passengers were never notified or made aware of the above issue. The Fire Rescue vehicles were requested to stay out of sight. The Flight Attendants were made aware of our situation in case the fire trucks did decide to converge on us; but were briefed that the flight was operating mostly normal.
Procedure,I arrived at the aircraft at XA:50 local to start the pre-flight. The aircraft was dark; no power (external or APU) but ground air was hooked-up. I initially thought the jet had been terminated and that I needed to power the jet up so the flight attendants could accomplish their pre-flight checks. I started my safety checks before applying external power to the airplane and when I got to the battery switch it was already on and there was no external power. The DC Volts for the battery read 8 volts. Also; the emergency lights were armed. The Ramp Agent was checking to see how much time we needed to be ready before we started boarding for a departure that was supposed to leave in approximately 45 minutes. I asked her to call maintenance to tell them the battery was dead and asked her to call ops to see if we could get external power hooked into the airplane. Once external was on; their was not enough power from the battery to get power on the airplane. Once maintenance arrived; they tried to get external power on and determined the battery was completely dead and would have to be changed.While maintenance was retrieving a battery; one of the Flight Attendants informed me that when she boarded the airplane; all the emergency lights were illuminated and had went out shortly thereafter. That meant that the emergency lights were running on the individual emergency lights batteries and that they depleted because there was no power on the aircraft. The Captain and I informed Maintenance that the emergency exit batteries had depleted due to the fact they were illuminated and went out while the Flight Attendants were on the airplane. At approximately XB:05 local; Maintenance finished replacing the battery and had power back on the airplane. Part of the Maintenance check list was to make sure the emergency lights worked but not determine how long the emergency lights batteries could last. Maintenance informed us that they were only required to test the emergency lights to see if they worked. Their checklist made no reference to the FAA requirement for the emergency lights batteries to power the emergency lights for a minimum of ten minutes (in case of evacuation). The Captain inquired how Maintenance would determine if the emergency lights batteries were sufficiently charged before signing off the Maintenance Release and they said their was no requirement per their checklist. The Captain called the Dispatcher and Maintenance Crew and Maintenance Crew said there was a minimum requirement of 180 minutes of power on the jet to trickle charge the emergency light batteries to assure a 10 minute charge was available for the emergency lights batteries. Maintenance Crew asked the Captain to write up the emergency lights batteries on the Electronic Logbook (ELB) to break the Maintenance Release so the batteries could trickle charge for 3 hours. About 5 minutes later ZZZ Maintenance signed the write up off and released the Maintenance Release. The Captain called Maintenance Crew back and asked them if that was correct and they reiterated that the batteries needed to trickle charge for three hours and that Maintenance Crew would break the Maintenance Release for the required 3 hours and 'lock out' ZZZ from signing the release until the three hours were up. At XC:00 local the Captain allowed the boarding process to start and contacted Maintenance Crew to sign the Maintenance Release and release the aircraft for flight. The boarding process was completed at approximately XC:40 local and we departed and flew the flight to ZZZ1 uneventfully.
Aircraft,In climb mode; FMC VNAV speed stuck at Flaps 1 minimum speed with flaps selected to Zero and FLAPS INDICATOR was indicating ZERO. Above 10;000 ft.; we selected ECON CLIMB; the FMC VNAV CLIMB MODE was still stuck at Flaps 1 Minimum Speed. There is no QRH procedure for this situation. We attempted to contact Maintenance; but to no avail. So we contacted Dispatch and coordinated for an air return to ZZZ. Report was filed; and Maintenance Control was contacted. We swapped aircraft and departed for ZZZ1.
Aircraft,During descent into ZZZ we were given a heading to join the sequence for landing. The autopilot was on and I selected the heading with the heading bug and pressed the HDG button on the STEC55X; the aircraft began turning but I noticed that the HSI card was not rotating. Once realizing that the autopilot was turning past the assigned heading; I disconnected the autopilot and referenced the magnetic compass and rolled the airplane back to the assigned heading. At this time I notified ZZZ Approach that we have had an instrument failure and that I was using a magnetic compass and the standby OBI for lateral navigation. I also requested that I be given 'No Gyro Turns and a No Gyro Approach' to assist with headings. It should be noted that I did not request priority handling; rather the priority handling was asked for me by ATC. I covered the instrument as trained with the TOLD card and handed the QRQ to the First Officer. This aircraft did have a co-pilot DG that was utilized as well as the G430 moving map to aid in SA. The approach was successfully completed and the aircraft was taxied back to the terminal without incident. There was a fire truck that followed us in; I did brief the passengers that the fire truck was due to equipment failure and that they were not in danger. I wished them safe travels and the passengers deplaned with no obvious signs of distress. I believe that the HSI card was jammed as I was still receiving NAV data on the CDI. However it should also be mentioned that this is the 3rd HSI that I have had fail and/or malfunction on me during flight in the last 9 months.
Aircraft,On departure from ZZZ; First Officer flying; passing approximately 17;000 ft.; I felt a sharp yaw and a brief turbulence as if passing through wake turbulence. I saw the left engine indications winding down. Requested priority handling and requested return to ZZZ. Moments after initial indications; fire warning activated; so ran we the engine fire checklist. After pulling fire handle fire indications stopped so we didn't fire the extinguisher bottle. Rest of the event went just like training in the sim; followed the checklists and landed safely on the long Runway XX. Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting inspected and followed us to the Gate. Single engine time was approximately 20 minutes.
Aircraft,ECAM Messages/Warnings:AUTO FLT AP OFFF/CTL ALTN LAW (PROT LOST)F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 2INOP SYS:F/CTL PROTELAC PITCHAP1&2CAT 2Unable to manually trim the stabilizer. Roles:Captain: Pilot Monitoring (PM)First Officer (FO): Pilot Flying (PF)Deadhead FO: DH PilotAt approximately XA:20 while approaching way point ZZZZZ on Airway at FL380 the autopilot #2 disengaged with an associated ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF. After an evaluation and finding no cause for the autopilot disengagement the autopilot #2 was re-engaged. Within minutes the aircraft pitched up slightly; as if in mountain wave; climbing approximately 70 ft. above the cruise altitude and an ECAM message F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 1 displayed. The aircraft then slightly pitched down to 70 ft. below cruise altitude and immediately ECAM message AUTO FLT AP OFF; F/CTL ALT LAW (PROT LOST) and F/CTL ELAC PITCH FAULT 2 displayed. Pilot Flying began hand flying the aircraft. We began the ECAM Procedures. I called the #1 Flight Attendant and instructed him to have the deadheading First Officer come to the cockpit immediately. Deadhead Pilot and I re-evaluated the systems failures and determined that the systems/computers could not be recovered. I then [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and requested FL260 since we could not stay in RSVM airspace without an autopilot. This also allowed a wider airspeed regime between Vmo and Alfa PROT in case pitch control became more of problem. Pilot Flying noted that the control input forces were increasing as we descended at 280 kt. indicated. We attempted to manually trim the aircraft with the pitch trim wheel; but the stabilizer appeared jammed at -0.8 up. I attempted to call Dispatch desk via the Crew Call app but reception was poor. Deadhead pilot looked up the ZZZ Commercial Radio frequency for me and I established communication with the Dispatcher and Airbus Maintenance desk. Maintenance advised us that if there was not a fix in the QRH there was nothing he could do for us. The aircraft was under control and Pilot Flying was able to override the now mistrimmed stabilizer with his side stick. The three of us and the Dispatcher then began discussions on diverting to the closest long runway. Something in the 8;000 to 10;000 ft. length range with airspace enough to configure; evaluate and handle any pitch problems that may present itself as we configured for landing. The four of use decided it was prudent to divert to ZZZ1 which was 140 NM away (120 miles closer than ZZZ2).I [requested priority handling] and informed ZZZZ Center that we were experiencing a flight control problem and request vectors to ZZZ1. ZZZZ gave us an off-airway vectors of 090deg then 100deg so to fly around restricted airspace while ZZZZ called for permission for use to fly through the restricted airspace direct to ZZZ1. I asked Deadhead Pilot to handle the radio communications while I briefed the flight attendant and passengers on the diversion and anticipated non-routine landing. The flight attendants were briefed for a non-routine landing. When done with cabin briefings and passenger address my attention returned to Pilot Flying and Deadhead Pilot. By this time; we had been handed off to ZZZ Center. I found that we were still flying the 100 degree heading. I queried ZZZ Center for the reason of this extended vector and was told it was because of restricted airspace to our north. I firmly reminded the Controller we were an aircraft in distress with flight control problem [and] that we had [requested priority handling] and if this vector continues; we're going to have fuel problems. I informed him this diversion was becoming pointless since the object of the diversion was to get this aircraft on the ground as soon as possible. I added that I could have been in ZZZ3 by now. We were immediately given a north heading towards ZZZ2.Approximately 20 minutes before landing passing 15;000 ft. (SAT-26) the pitch trimwheel lurched nose down a few inches and began trimming normally. Pilot Flying commented that side stick input forces became normal. The stabilizer continued to trim normally during all speed and configurations changes as flaps were extended. The ECAM messages remained displayed. Deadhead Pilot had completed a landing distance assessment using a non-normal; DIRECT LAW calculation. (Note: A non-normal; stabilizer jam calculation resulted in the same distance) We asked for and received a 20 NM final approach. We completed our applicable checklists and informed the Flight Attendants that we were 10 minutes from landing.Pilot Flying; Deadhead Pilot and I briefed that we would be fully configured and 160 kts. prior to gear extension so that only small a small amount of pitch trim would be required to stabilize the approach when the flight control system degrades to DIRECT LAW. Pilot Flying landed the aircraft perfectly and we rolled out; turned off the runway to taxi to the gate. Pilot Flying commented the aircraft required a firmer side stick input to flare due to the Direct Mode. I made a passenger address assuring them of our safety and thanking them for their cooperation with the Flight Attendant's instruction.I met with the Mechanic meeting our flight and briefed him on our experienced. He was grateful we had stayed to discuss the failures with him. When we blocked in and shut down the engines all the ECAM messages had cleared and only an ECAM Class II F/CTL indication remained. The faults remained in the Multipurpose Control Display Unit>Maintenance>Current Flight Report print out. Deadhead Pilot and I had operated Aircraft X/DATE that morning down to ZZZZ1. Starting the initial decent on the ZZZZZ1 2A STAR into ZZZZ1 we had experienced three autopilot disconnects. The first two occurred prior to the way point ZZZZZ3 on the STAR. ZZZZZ3 was to be crossed between FL230 and FL210. Prior to the third disconnect I saw the pitch trim wheel jerk forward approximately an inch. An ECAM warning would flash on the display then disappear. Descending below FL180 the autopilot was re-engaged and was used for the remainder of the STAR and RWY XXR LOC and GS capture. The pitch trim worked normally as we slowed on the arrival and configured for landing.At gate arrival in ZZZZ1; we called for Maintenance and described what we experienced. Maintenance printed a Maintenance Current Flight Report from the Multipurpose Control Display Unit which indicated warns of XU:23 AUTO FLT AP OFF and XU:27 F/CTL. Failure messages were: XU:21 AFS:ELAC1 and XU:25 AFS:ELAC1. There was a Class II Maintenance Message F/CTL displayed on the Status page. Maintenance went to work clearing these faults.I could not have hopped for a better qualified crew to meet this challenge. I had flown with Deadhead Pilot before; but this was my first flight with Pilot Flying. Deadhead Pilot brought 30 years of Airbus experience to the flight deck including time at various airlines. Pilot Flying brought 22 years of Airbus experience to the flight. Their performance was both profession and stellar. They never stopped working the problem. Flight Attendant 1; Flight Attendant 3; Flight Attendant 4 worked as a team preparing our passengers for a non-routine landing and keeping communications to the cockpit to a minimum during this diversion allowing us to work the problem uninterrupted. I would recommend that Dispatch and Commercial Radio VHF frequency pages found in the FOM be included in the QRH for easier referencing.
Human Factors,On initial climb out; prior to thrust reduction at approximately 600 feet AGL; two small red lights appeared just off the nose and slightly left of the aircraft. As the aspect changed; there became 3 red lights. It was apparent that this was a drone. The drone passed just outside my window (left side). Our speed was approximately 160 kts so it went by rapidly. The three of us colorfully acknowledge the passing of the drone and a call was made to ATC to report the drone. We then began to assess for possible damage. After configuration clean up and established on a departure course we determined that from our seats; there was no impact. As a precaution; we contacted all the Flight Attendants; explained what had happened and asked if anyone heard anything unusual. None were observed. The flight continued to destination uneventfully. Upon arrival a 'post-flight inspection' was made to the best of our abilities considering that it was an international flight and we were unable to access the ramp due to customs regulations. No damage could be seen at that time from our vantage point. Between the three cockpit crew members we felt that the drone passed no more than 15 feet from the aircraft; eye level with me; yet made no impact. The red lights were on the corners of this drone. We passed close enough that the red glow of the drones lights reflected off its arms which were white and looked like bowling pins. Some idiot was flying a drone on or near the airport. Don't let idiots or smart people fly drones on or near airports.
Environment - Non Weather Related,[During] daytime VMC we performed an Auto-land Confidence check. Just after the 500 ft. call the plane nosed down toward 1;000 VSI. PF disconnected AP and landed manually. [This was possibly a] 5G issue. Auto-land was normal till 500 ft. [I suggest] more confidence checks so that we catch auto-land systems that are out of tolerances day VFR.
Aircraft,Enroute at Flight level 370; flight crew including three flight attendants encountered a fume/odor event. No source could be determined. [Priority handling was requested]. Flight crew made decision to divert to ZZZ.
Human Factors,Planned departure of XB:40 from ZZZZ. We arrived at the aircraft at XA:40 to a dark flight deck with only the ground service bus powered. This was the fourth flight of a three-day trip for the Captain-in-training during his first OE sequence. This was also the Captain-in-training qualification flight to/from ZZZZ. The Captain-in-training was the Pilot Flying (PF). ZZZZ had a 1000 ft. ceiling that was clear above 2000 ft. AGL. After a normal takeoff; the right seat Pilot Monitoring (PM) instructor noticed the gear was not retracting and informed the PF the gear were not coming up. Since we were climbing at the 0/Ret Minimum Maneuver speed until we were clear of terrain; we were climbing at 215 kts. We asked to level at 9;000 ft. and hold over the airfield at the ZZZZ1 VOR. It was suspected the nose gear pin had been left in and was possibly missed during the salute. I had considered running the 'Landing Gear Lever Will Not Move Up After Takeoff' QRH. However; the conditions were not met because the gear handle did move up. An attempt was unsuccessfully made to retract the gear by recycling the gear handle. The aircraft was below maximum landing weight and we had a safe landing configuration; so the decision was made to return to ZZZZ to have the suspected bypass pin removed if that was the problem. Upon returning to the gate; it was discovered the pin was not left in the nose gear and Maintenance found no faults in the gear operating system. Upon returning to the flight deck; the Instructor Pilot discovered the manual gear extension access door was ajar. The light on the aft pedestal was not illuminated during preflight and we were not aware of when that door was breached. Upon resetting the access door on the flight deck floor; the light on the aft pedestal extinguished and it was clear we had resolved the problem. An INFO-ITEM was entered into the Approved Model List and the aircraft departed and flew to ZZZ uneventfully with a 60 minute delay.OE training; hit city special qualification airfield training; terrain; weather; ATC foreign communication.Ensure the manual extension access door is firmly closed during every preflight and before takeoff.
Aircraft,On landing; 'steering inop' caution message came on. I took control of the aircraft from the First Officer and was able; using the aircraft's energy and differential braking; to exit the Runway at Taxiway 1. I stopped the aircraft and informed Tower Control we could not taxi safely. The First Officer ran the QRH and then the fault reset manual. Ours was the 3rd reset in 3 days; however; the nose wheel steering did not reset and we made arrangements for a tow to the Gate.
Human Factors,On Date; I was assigned to work on Aircraft X. The aircraft was out of service due to hydraulic contamination issues. I was assigned with Mechanic to a transit inspection check. While doing the exterior inspection of the tires I found the #2 and #4 tires worn. The #2 MLG tire was replaced without incident. Using the same 95 ton jack; with the #4 MLG tire removed and the new tire secured on the axle. I entered the flight deck to release the parking breaks to allow the rotation of the tire to facilitate the torquing of the nut; to complete the installation. I released the brakes and heard and felt a loud noise from the aircraft. I reset the brakes to secure the aircraft. Upon further evaluation the axle jack was ejected from the right MLG strut. The jack struck the service cart parked approximately 12 ft. forward of the gear. I noticed hydraulic fluid on the floor under the jack as well as the underside of the axle. It appeared that the jack had failed. None of the others assigned were hurt as other maintenance was being performed. Name and I went to retrieve another jack to complete the torquing of the #4 tire and accomplish a more detailed inspection of the underside of the Right MLG. An initial inspection found damage to a bracket for electrical conduits as well as the forward edge of the truck.
Aircraft,Shortly after take off #1 Iinertial Reference System failed causing Pilot's PFD (primary flight display) to quit working. Flight controls were transfered to the Copilot and after not being able to recover the failed IRS it was requested to TRACON the return to ZZZ. We were asked if we needed priority handling and the response was negative. Aircraft was degraded in navigational aids and vectors were requested in VMC conditions. Since the moment the aircraft took off until landing the flight was uneventful apart from the situation above mentioned.
Aircraft,While on approach into ZZZ we experienced a trailing edge flap asymmetry while configuring for landing. Routing was cleared direct to ZZZZZ; cleared for the ILS XX in day visual conditions. The aircraft was configured flaps 1; gear up crossing ZZZZZ; speed 200 kts. (rough guess). Flaps were selected to 5; and then 15 when intercepting the glide slope; maintaining speed 170 kts. until 2;300 ft. MSL (2;000 ft. AGL). At this point; gear down; flaps 20 was selected and I; the pilot flying; called for speed 20 which was roughly around 140 kts. At this point I noticed the control wheel starting to turn to the right and noticed the flap asymmetry (autopilot on). We received the EICAS message flap asymmetry and then abandoned the approach at 2;000 ft. We requested vectors for a large box pattern; [requested priority handling] and advised ATC of our situation and our intentions of returning via vectors back to the ILS XX after running a checklist. On this particular flight we had two jump seaters; both were 757 crew members who were scheduled to take the plane we were flying back to ZZZ1. The Captain on the jump seat assisted the operating Captain with the checklist; while I flew the aircraft. The checklist for trailing edge flap asymmetry was run in accordance with standard procedures. After completing the checklist; a successful landing was made with flaps 20.
Human Factors,Aircraft was not under power. The push-back started with good communication and no abnormal issues between Captain and Tug Driver. The push-back speed was slower than normal; which caused Flight Crew to wonder if Tug Driver was new at the job. Immediately after verbalizing this thought; the tug abruptly stopped. Simultaneously; Ramp called to say that the aircraft passing behind us was not a factor for our push-back. The Captain relayed that information to the Tug Driver; believing that the Tug Driver stopped because of another aircraft. That is when the Tug Driver informed the Captain that he might have hit a truck. Once confirmed; the Captain called Dispatch and Operations and I informed the Passengers that we had reportedly made contact with a truck on push-back and that we would be returning to the gate once it was determined safe to do so. After about 10-15 minutes; we were towed back to Gate XX. Left wing scimitar struck truck parked outside safety zone during push-back.
Human Factors,We taxied to Runway XXR; via Taxiway '1' and held short of the Runway on the taxi line. This placed our aircraft at a 45-degree angle to the Runway with a view of final. There was [another carrier] on short final and another aircraft behind them. While stopped with the parking brake set; I caught movement out the left side window. A light twin-engine aircraft somehow had gone around our wing and was passing by our nose. They crossed the hold short line and headed towards the runway. I broadcast over Tower frequency 'Go-around! Go-around!'[The light twin-engine aircraft] came to a rocking stop about 25 ft. past the runway hold short line. [Aircraft on short final] immediately started a go-around and broadcast that on Tower frequency. The Tower then gave them missed approach instructions. I didn't know if the Tower could see what had happened from their location; so I said on Tower frequency '[light twin-engine aircraft] is across the hold line.' The Tower confirmed with [light twin-engine aircraft] that they were across the hold line and then told [second aircraft on final approach] to go around. After a few moments; the Tower instructed [light twin-engine aircraft] to taxi down the runway; exit at Taxiway '2' and enter the holding block. After the runway was clear; we were cleared for takeoff.
Aircraft,During the latter part of our climbout from ZZZ; we observed a LOW PRESSURE caution light on the ENG 1 Hydraulic Pump for System A. After checking for and noting full quantity and pressure in System A; we ran the QRH Checklist which consisted of turning the pump off. A little over a half hour later; we noticed decreasing hydraulic quantity in System A; it went as low as 11% (but pressure stayed constant at approximately 3;000 PSI throughout the flight). Shortly thereafter; on the initial descent into ZZZ1; we got a LOW PRESSURE caution for the ENG 2 Hydraulic Pump on System B. We again ran the same QRH procedure and switched off that hydraulic pump. Even though the electric pumps were maintaining full hydraulic pressure; we were concerned that we had a limited amount of time before significant functional degradation of our hydraulic systems began; particularly with the fluid loss on System A. Knowing at that point that we were due to receive the standard long; low-altitude vectors into ZZZ1; we requested priority handling and received priority handling for a long; straight-in approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ1. We configured early and everything went normally concluding in a 40-degree flap landing. After landing we carefully checked that hydraulic pressure was still normal on both sides (it was) and had the responding Fire Crews check for visible external fluid leaks. The responding crews did not notice any leaks/fluid and System A Hydraulic Quantity had stabilized at 20%; so we taxied into the gate.
Human Factors,We were on the ZZZZZ1 X for Runway XX to ZZZ; 'descending via'; and then given direct ZZZZZ1. Full automation was engaged; autopilot; autothrottles; LNAV/VNAV. No approach assignment was given at this time. The next ATC instruction was 'direct ZZZZZ; cross ZZZZZ at 4000 ft.; cleared for the RNAV RNP Z Runway XX.' With the approach previously loaded; ZZZZZ was moved under ZZZZZ; from the STAR. A hard 4000 ft.; at ZZZZZ was verified in the FMC; 1500 ft. was set in the altitude window and verified for the crossing restriction at the FAF ZZZZZ2. Full automation was engaged and windows closed. About six miles from ZZZZZ the aircraft began to slow from 240 knots to 210 knots; which seemed early for the speed restriction at ZZZZZ3. My attention was outside; looking for the field; and an aircraft ahead of us. We noticed the aircraft was at 2800 ft.; but we were still four miles from ZZZZZ. The First Officer (OF) immediately began a climb back to 4000 ft. Approach then said they showed us low on the arrival; and would we like the visual to Runway XX; or would we be able to return to 4000 ft. by ZZZZZ. We crossed ZZZZZ at 4000 ft.; re-verified all inputs and automation; and continued with the approach. Following this; the approach; landing; and taxi-in were uneventful; and no request to contact on ATC on landline.
Human Factors,On arrival to ZZZ; we were cleared for the Park Visual Runway XX at night. We were configured and stabilized at the 1000 ft. call. As the aircraft was in the final arcing left turn; just prior to the 500 ft. callout to the runway; we received a caution obstacle call out. Simultaneously; the ZZZ Tower called us with a Low Altitude Alert; which we acknowledged; and the First Officer disconnected the autopilot and auto-throttles and performed a smooth maneuver to stop the descent and start a climb. The First Officer and I were both sensing that the approach started to look low to us; in reference to the runway; and the runway VASI information showing us a little low. The maneuvering would not have caused the Passengers any concern.The approach remained stabilized and we agreed to continue to the runway and land; since we had the runway and VASI information. The landing was on speed and in the Touchdown Zone. Taxi to the gate was uneventful. After discussing the approach with the First Officer numerous times; (that night and the next day) to go over what might have happened; or if we missed something; we could not conclude that we knew the exact cause. However; from our reviews; we both saw that the Flight Director was 'centered' throughout the approach. We both cannot be 100 [percent] certain that when this event occurred; that the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator) was in VNAV Path or another mode that could have caused the aircraft to drift too low. When I got to the hotel that night; I called the [Company] Chief Pilot and explained what had happened; and to verify that the FDAP (Flight Data Analysis Program) data would be captured that would help in this event.
Aircraft,The battery discharge light illuminated on climbout. We ran the QRH and talked to Maintenance and Dispatch and Chief Pilot and all agreed on a return to ZZZ for an overweight landing. We ran the numbers and brake cooling and decided it was the safe option. Returned to ZZZ for an uneventful landing and return to gate.
Chart Or Publication,I was the First Officer acting as Pilot Flying landing Runway 12R at MMUN. When coordinating with the Captain the transfer of controls; we were given runway exit instructions to 'join Taxiway A'. Having been to MMUN 10+ times; I assumed we would take A3 to proceed east on A; then south on D; then west on C. However; as we reached the end of A3; the Controller told us to make a hard right onto A and hold short of H2. Taxiway A does not exist on the Jeppesen Chart on my EFB. After the flight I verified my chart database was updated.
Human Factors,We were cleared for the visual approach to ISP; Runway XX on an extended left base. I started a gradual descent in Vertical Speed from 2000 ft. to 1300 ft. The glideslope intercept at ZZZZZ is 1271 ft. Since we had a 90 degree cut to a short final; I reasoned it would be easier to hand fly. After disconnecting the autopilot and auto throttles; while focusing on airspeed and configuration; with the sun directly in my eyes; I drifted below 1200 ft. There is a 646 ft. Tower just prior to ZZZZZ; which triggered an 'Obstacle' warning; and with my slow sink; followed by a 'Pull Up.' I heeded the warning; began the emergency escape maneuver; the warning and caution ceased; and shortly after; the First Officer called out the obstacle and that we were clear. The correction did not cause a go-around; and the remainder of the approach and landing was uneventful.
Aircraft,Flight A; Flight B; Flight C.I was the Pilot Flying on all 3 of these legs and all were the RNAV (RNP) Z 17R in DEN. In all three approaches just inside of JOULE FAP on autopilot; the aircraft began a turn from the runway centerline. The first two times it was to the right and the third time was to the left. All three approaches were conducted in VMC; one night and two day. First two times I disengaged the autopilot/auto-throttle and hand flew to landing. Having seen this twice and with the Captain's concurrence; I allowed the autopilot to continue the third approach where it did get back to the runway centerline prior to 1000 ft. In my opinion these excursions were fairly significant in that it took us over the centerline of the parallel taxiway. During parallel approaches this could possibly lead to loss of separation. Also; in IMC this could be quite disconcerting. These were all three separate aircraft on three separate days. I feel it necessary to investigate further. I've seen these on ILS and LOC approaches but always felt it was interference from aircraft in the ILS Zone. This being a RNAV; I don't have an explanation for this to happen at all much less repeatedly.
Human Factors,Flight was late departing by more than two hours due to a ground stop in [destination] first; then by rain and lightning in the STL area. We finally had pushed back from the gate. It was dark and heavy rain. Because there was lightning in the area; crews had to use hand signals with ground teams. As our ground crew disconnected and returned to gate area; we noticed [an adjacent] gate began pushing back towards us. If you look at STL ramp; there is no room for both to push at the same time. I called on Company radio for them to stop while my First Officer turned on all of the aircraft landing lights. Luckily; the Ground Crew stopped pushing before there was an aircraft accident. We got them to shut down and pull forward so we could depart.I think there are a few things happening here that caused this almost aircraft collision to take place. One; overall visibility was very reduced from it being night; raining hard and the ramp area not well illuminated. Two; the use of hand signals during pushback reduces communication between Flight Crews and Ground Crews. Three; the fact we have been adding new Employees recently to fill shortages results in Employees with very little experience and possibly training. The aircraft on [the adjacent gate] should have never started to push. The Pilots in that aircraft can't see behind them so they rely on the Ground Crews to look and see if there is anything behind them. Kind of hard to miss a [large aircraft] even in the dark and rain. Their Wing Walker was giving the stop signal to the driver; with crossed wands and aircraft continued to push back. Only thing I can assume is Ground Crews are either not trained well or they are just not following their Ground Ops procedures. Not sure this Wing Walker concept is really being taken seriously by the required Ground Ops Personnel.
Equipment / Tooling,During push-back the aircraft broke away from the tug. The tug driver called 'breakaway breakaway' perfectly and I gently applied the brakes and stopped the aircraft. The tug driver said that the hitch between the tug and the tow bar had become disconnected. They disconnected the tow bar from the plane and we were able to taxi away from where we stopped. The tug driver did an excellent job recovering from his error by using standard phraseology during a startling event.
Aircraft,During takeoff roll; First Officer (FO) as PF (Pilot Flying); airspeed did not seem to be accelerating normally; but it was subtle. As we approached the call out for 100 knots; it became apparent that the Captain's airspeed indicators (analog and digital tape) were substantially lagging behind the FO's and the standby instruments. Just after the Captain's airspeed read 100 knots; the actual airspeed was nearly at V1. We continued the takeoff because we were already in the high-speed regime. Shortly after liftoff; there was an IAS Disagree EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) message and caution. We applied the Immediate Action steps and consulted the QRC (hard card). I then went into my iPad Electronic Flight Manual for the rest of the checklist items. The highest difference noted between the Captain's airspeed and the standby and FO's airspeed was approximately 60 knots.I assigned the FO to take the radios and continue to fly while I ran thru the checklist. We informed ATC of our problem and asked to stay in the local area to troubleshoot. We were sent to the ZZZZZ intersection and told to hold as published at 3;000 feet. We asked for 10 NM legs in the holding pattern and were given clearance for that request. We later asked for a higher altitude for a margin of safety and were assigned 7;000 feet.I then sent a message to Dispatch to call me and subsequently received a message to call AIRINC for Company phone patch. I spoke to Dispatch (NAME) and asked him to get Maintenance Control on the line; which he did. Throughout this phone patch; communication was very difficult. It seemed that all three of us were having difficulty hearing each other at times; and I was not always sure who was talking or if anyone was hearing me.We made several turns in holding as we waited for inputs from Maintenance Control and for Dispatch to work out the numbers for a possible overweight landing back in ZZZ. Dispatch first sent us landing weights for Flaps 30 on Runway XXL; which was not the active runway. Then he sent data for Flaps 30 to RWY YYL. I informed him that we needed Flaps 20 data due to the directives in the IAS Disagree procedure; so he sent me data for Flaps 25. At that point I gave up on the communication about the flaps and landing data because we had consulted the Abnormal Configuration chart in the Flight Manual and we had plenty of margin available under the conditions for RWY YYL. Maintenance Control asked to be let off the call after we made the decision to return to ZZZ. Once we were all in agreement about making the return to ZZZ; Dispatch asked on a couple of occasions if we were planning to request priority handling. I said I would be; once we were ready to return. After confirming all items in the FM procedure were addressed and we obtained ATIS information and briefed the approach; we requested vectors out of holding and for the diversion back to ZZZ. I also received priority handling and gave ATC the requested information regarding fuel remaining; souls on board; and the nature of the problem.We received vectors to return and informed ATC about our higher-than-normal approach speed; since the procedure required a Flaps 20 approach. We flew the visual approach to RWY YYL and landed without incident. Touch down was smooth and well within the touchdown zone. We cleared the runway and saw emergency vehicles heading our way; so I stopped momentarily on the taxiway. ATC asked if we wanted to cancel the priority. I looked at the brake temperatures and they looked okay; so we cancelled the priority handling and taxied without incident to Gate X. The Brake Temp light did come on at the gate for a few minutes; but we had already let operations know about it before anyone approached the airplane. The brakes cooled down seemingly quickly thereafter. A write up was made and a few representatives from operations came to the aircraft to ask more questions about what had happened. We did not take that airplane to ZZZ1 that day; but did see in the maintenance document the next day that there was an obstruction found in the pitot static system after our returned flight the previous day.
Human Factors,Followed Airport Operations [vehicle] to aircraft on [Runway] XXR. Parked Super tug in front of aircraft about 20 feet away Rotated seat and opened cradle. While opening cradle saw Company Maintenance give the set break signal and then ask for cabin door to be opened. Door was opened and Maintenance went to get gear pins for us. Once he got on [the] aircraft it started to roll; I hit the side of the plane to get Flight Crew's attention and gave him the set brake signal he looked confused. The aircraft continued to roll I went to see if I could get the tug away from the plane. Too late aircraft rolled into the tug hit the open part of the tug and came to a stop. Maintenance came off the aircraft watched me back away from the aircraft nose gear and then gave us the all clear. Name pinned the gear I connected to the nose gear and the rest of the tow went as planed.
Airport,We landed on [Runway] XXR in ZZZ normally. We were given taxi instructions [for Taxiways] 1; 2; 3; 4 to the ramp. The Captain was taxiing cautiously as we had briefed prior to landing that they were probably less than ideal traction-wise. The taxi was uneventful until we started to make the left turn from [Taxiway] 3 onto Taxiway 4. After initiating the left turn; the Captain stated (and I could feel that) we were skidding. The Captain added a small amount of thrust onto the #2 engine which caused the aircraft to overshoot the yellow centerline of the taxiway and possibly make contact with one of the taxiway lights on the left side. We both quickly realized the taxiway was very slippery (NIL in our assessment). After arresting the left yaw moment we started to quickly turn to the right to which we noticed at the rate we were turning would have caused us to exit the taxiway to the right. I suggested activating reverse thrust to stop us from moving forward. I noticed the Captain had his hands full with steering and the rudder pedals/brakes. I then momentarily applied reverse thrust which stopped us from continuing our right hand turn. After this; we regained positive control and the remainder of the taxi-in to the ramp/gate was uneventful. The main cause of this event was the very poor (if not NIL) braking action on that portion of the taxiway which coincided with our needing to turn from [Taxiway] 3 onto [Taxiway] 4.Once we arrived in the chocks at the gate we discussed the event at length. We could have stopped prior to making the turn but didn't feel that traction was an issue until we were fairly committed to the turn. Had we attempted to stop after initiating the turn we would have certainly slid off the taxiway into the grass median between [Taxiways] 4 and 5. The Captain had his hands full attempting to regain control and I did what I could to support his efforts.
Weather,Aircraft X called on SATCOM and advised that they experienced serve turbulence while level at FL 310 just south of RJAA. They advised that the aircraft was uncontrollable and that were now in control; but heading back to RJBB or RJAA. Aircraft X was given a direct after TONDA direct ADNAP after takeoff. Just south of RJAA they experience serve turbulence; that caused momentary loss of control of the aircraft. They did [request priority landing]; dumped fuel; and returned to RJBB.
Aircraft,In flare on Runway XXR at ZZZ; FO (First Officer) reported that yoke felt stuck during flare back pressure application; it released prior to touchdown causing significant back pressure application and yolk movement; luckily the timing was good and we touched down normally. Post flight no restrictions noted in the control movement. Advised Maintenance.
Human Factors,Cleared to taxi to Runway 2L via [Taxiway] A. Upon reaching [Taxiway] Hotel intersection a ground vehicle exiting the runway at [Taxiway] Hotel crossed [Taxiway] A in front of me and was told to hold short of [Taxiway] A; I had to come to a full stop. I asked my FO (First Officer) to inquire ATC and said I would not continue until they provide a new clearance. The FO didn't seem to understand and seemed 'checked out' so I took over the radio and told ATC what happened and that I was ready to taxi with a reissued clearance. ATC re-cleared us to taxi as previously cleared.
Aircraft,Leg 1 of OE trip with a new Captain. When we started to taxi the tiller would move left but was jammed and could not steer left. Called Maintenance for a tow back to the gate. I had our FAA designee jump seater review the logbook while we accomplished all the duties and coordination related to a gate return. Previous write up. When Maintenance showed up they had a can of cleaner and a rag and another Maintenance technician was carrying a pole with a log book retriever on it. They wiped the valve off; and asked if it was OK. The Captain attempted to move the tiller. Very stiff; 3 times harder to move compared to normal. I requested we be towed in because it still wasn't correct. We were on Aircraft X heading to airports that were currently plowed 70 ft. wide with FICON of 3/3/3. Some of these runways require a 180 turn on the Runway. When we got to the gate a Maintenance lead came on board; told us the assembly had been cleaned after the previous write up and he found an 'ice crystal' on it and we should be good to go. Under the circumstances I requested a new aircraft. Upon landing in ZZZ and updating my flight plan I noticed an email from ZZZ1 base chief asking about what happened and that he had been 'Jumped' by ZZZ1 Maintenance about us (me) refusing the aircraft. I believe this is unacceptable behavior from Company Maintenance personnel. The cause of this behavior was operational pressures. Lesson learned is I wish I had not opened that email when I was updating my flight plan. I assumed it was something very important because I was contacted prior than finishing duty. It was very distracting for us on our last leg of a very long day with challenging conditions.
Aircraft,This flight took place from ZZZ1 to ZZZ on a clear day for most of our route. Just after leveling off at cruise; the Master Caution - LANDING GEAR INOP turned on. The FO was flying and called for the checklist. We ran the checklist which led to the determination that the normal way to put the gear down (gear handle) could potentially lead to one of the gears being stuck in the nacelle. It also told us we needed to eventually run the ALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSION checklist which we knew would take about 10-15 minutes in our estimation. Funny enough; the First Officer and check pilot (who was conducting a line check) had flown together this year and had a similar issue which required them to run the ALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSION checklist. This was actually a great help to me and our decision-making process since we had knowledge from two experienced pilots who had done this procedure before in the actual airplane. With a strong headwind we knew we had plenty of time to talk and plan. We first talked to dispatch and maintenance to let them know of the situation and that we would continue on to ZZZ. They had nothing to add in terms of further instruction. After; we decided to [request priority handling] to get priority into ZZZ and to give ATC time to coordinate for us since we knew we needed to descend earlier than usual and slow down to run the checklist. Next; we made sure to keep the Flight Attendants in the loop and decided to let the passengers know later of the situation just prior to descent so they wouldn't be worrying for this lengthy leg. We tried to knock out a couple of things before descent to minimize workload while running the ALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSION checklist.The First Officer suggested I fly the plane since most of the doors and handles we had to pull were on his side; so I took the plane. We briefed threats and the plan; obtained weather and performance; as well as ran the 'Descent Checklist.' One key piece of information from the First Officer's previous time running the checklist was that if undesired indication appeared for the gear; this would extend the checklist and further lead us to another checklist which would add even more time. So the descent plan for us was a crucial part. We planned the descent very conservatively to give us ample time for any hiccups. We decided we needed to descend around ZZZ2. We further coordinated with ATC and told them our plan to start our descent to 15;000 ft. and slow to 185 KIAS near ZZZ2. We also requested XXR with a planned exit at taxiway 1. Per the checklist and the check airman's suggestion; we thought this would allow for easier taxiing since we would lose nose wheel steering once we ran the ALTERNATE GEAR EXTENSION checklist. We also called dispatch once more to update them that we requested priority handling and to request parking spots X; Y; Z; and A for straight shot off of taxiway 1. When the First Officer checked in with station; we learned they gave us A. At ZZZ2; we started our descent. Once at altitude and airspeed; we ran the checklist successfully getting the gear down. This took far less time than we anticipated; but in retrospect we would have done it the same way to give us more cushion. Once the gear was down; we advised ATC we were ready for the approach and to have a tug on standby. ATC at this point had begun vectoring us on to the ILS XXR approach. The approach and landing was non-eventful for the most part. The glide slope was dipping and rising a little more than usually most likely due to aircraft taking off; but nothing extreme. I did elect to eventually take the plane off autopilot at some point on the approach to be more stable. We landed and I did a very slow taxi off 1. I had never made any turns without the tiller; but decided I would take the taxi very slow and if I had any doubt would stop the plane and ask for a tow. Getting off taxiway 1 was no problem; lining up with the J-Line during parking was a little more difficult; but definitely safe; and doable. We parked the plane and put the discrepancy in the maintenance logbook. The First Officer and the check airmen were a great help to the success of this flight and I cannot thank them enough. Although this flight seemed very uneventful from an outside perspective; there were a lot of things in play. I had been a Captain just over X months; the First Officer had been here under a year; we were getting line checked; yet we were all able to work together as a crew and get the job done. Kudos to them and our training department. I think overall we worked well as a crew. My First Officer and check airmen were a great help. I feel as though I might have over-relied on them; but we had many good discussions in the cockpit and used everyone's perspective and knowledge to come to a safe plan. The aircraft was in control the entire time. The taxiing for me was the most unusual part. It was safe at all times; but just felt unnatural and awkward. In the end; we got the job done and didn't exceed any limitations. I definitely learned the importance of CRM. Discussing and being on the same page with one another was a key part of this flight's success. My two regrets are not giving a thorough PA to the Passengers and not checking in with the Flight Attendants fully. Although I advised the Flight Attendants that the gear was coming down early; I didn't advise the Passengers about this. I did advise them of the situation; but I hope the gear coming down earlier than usual didn't alarm anybody too much. Secondly; I believe the Flight Attendants had one more leg home to ZZZ3 after this. I'm not sure if they were working the flight or not; but I wish that we had time to debrief or talk. Although it might have been a non-event for them; next time I wish there was a way for me to stop them and make sure they were fully okay before heading off. We were already delayed as it was so they were rushed off to the next plane. I hope I have the discernment to stop the operation next time to make sure the entire crew is okay.
Human Factors,I got a call on my cell phone from [name] that I had assigned flight X/ZZZ . I let him know that there was nothing on my device and also show him that it was on my device. At this time I had to find my crew for the flight. When I first got to the flight I found out that the bypass pin was broken so my crew could not connect the towbar and push tractor. I call on the radio for a bypass pin and  [name] call my cell phone to let [equipment clerk] know that she had given the equipment room an extra bypass pin. I go to the equipment room for bypass pin when I got there the equipment clerk told that she had already given it out. I let [name] know that it was already given out and she said that  [name] was on his a way with a bypass pin to my flight. We began to load the flight with 39 mins left before departure. We quickly loaded the forward [cargo compartment] first starting with F2 [compartment] with the freight (1150) and then F1 [compartment] with 38 bags and 3 pieces of pps and two which were DG. Once we finished the forward cargo we move to the back AFT and quickly starting loading in A1 with 42 bags and to A2 with 17 bags. At this time I found out we were missing 17 bags from two flights. I then I let [name] know that they were missing. Then  [name]  got on the phone and call to see if the bags were going to make the flight when he finish talking he let me know that they was not going to make it. Then [name] called over radio asking me to wait 5 mins for 1 bag come to the flight. Once the  bags didn't show up [name] told  me to wait because he saw a driver coming. It turned out that it was not the bag for this flight and he told me go ahead and lock up the flight. We lock up flight and when I got ready to finalize the flight I notice that only 1 DG item was showing in the device; there were actually 2 [loaded on aircraft]. I came to the training room to get help correcting fixing this. After error was corrected I try to finalize the flight. I got error message that I have never seen before. The trainer recognized this message meaning that aircraft was out of balance and I needed to call [load control]. I call [load control] and told them the message I was seeing. She ask me what happen and I told her that 17 bags didn't make the flight. She said  that she had to talk to her supervisor and put me on hold. After several minutes notice I was not on hold and immediately call them back. When I called them back she said she needed to talk to my manager because they had to move three passenger from first class to coach and put back on hold for several mins. After several more mins load agent came back and told me to try to finalize the flight. I made the entry and the flight finalized.This event occurred for several reasons. the first was a common one; the device never displayed this assignment. When it was assigned to me; which forced a modification to come to me and notify me of it. By the time I was told of this assignment there was only 45 minutes to departure. this is a common problem with the device program and management has been aware of this since the program was rolled out. It needs to be addressed and fixed so we get our assignments in a timely manner. Second; lack of equipment is also a common problem here as well as OTS equipment being issued to us in our equipment box needs to be a addressed and correct these things that take precious time to replace. Our requests for help with this has gone unanswered.
Human Factors,Aircraft X piloted by Captain was cleared to land Runway 14. Upon my landing flair; Local Controller calmly reported; 'Go around; go-around; go-around.' I immediately executed a go-around maneuver when I saw a green 'gator' vehicle enter Runway 14 from my right to my left. I crossed at 800 ft. and 25 ft. above the vehicle. Go-around was uneventful and landing was made without further incident. Local controller states that he forgot about them when he cleared me to land. I did not see the vehicle on downwind or final due to landing onto to the morning sun. No injuries or damage resulted. Controller was very professional and accepted full responsibility for the incident. Moving forward I believe a better scan could be used especially landing into the sun which I believe was a contributing factor. Ultimately the situation was properly handled by ATC and Pilot.
Aircraft,While executing the ILS LOC XXR (It was either XXR or L); descending and decelerating; I prompted Flaps 1. Then; I prompted Flaps 5; however the Captain noted that the flap indicator was stuck at Flaps 1. We stopped at the appropriate airspeed and [requested priority handling]. We executed the Go Around; and landed without further incident after completing the Quick Reference Checklist/Quick Reference Handbook procedures. The manual flap extension worked as procedures indicated they would.
Human Factors,We were cleared direct to the IAF (CARCO) and directed to keep best forward speed. We kept 250 kts until intercepting the IAF and Captain (Pilot Flying 'PF') went thrust idle to begin our slow down. We captured the localizer course and ATC told us to keep 170KTS or greater to the FAF (ESSAY). We were not slowing quickly enough; so PF put out the flight spoilers. We captured the GS and the plane began its descent to follow the GS. We were still around 240 kts and we were not slowing; so PF disconnected the Auto Pilot and leveled off momentarily to slow to 230 Kts so we could get 'flaps 8'. During this level off; we got one dot high on the GS.  PF began correcting to follow the GS down. Slowing to 220 kts PF called for 'flaps 20' and then 'gear down'.  Once at speed; PF called 'Flaps 45; before landing check'.  Sometime during this I received our clearance to land runway 4. I read off the items for before landing check.  The PF was still hand flying the approach and we recaptured the GS; but there were over corrections and we got 1 dot below the GS. Simultaneously; Tower issued a call stating 'Low altitude alert. Aircraft X' Captain said to me 'correcting'. So I told tower 'correcting'. I missed my call-out for  '1;000 ft above; stable'.  We broke out of the clouds at 1;000 AGL and I called runway in sight. We landing and taxied to the gate without incident. I should have spoken up to begin our slowdown sooner. We were too fast to begin an approach. This lead us to have to 'catch up' on configurations and call outs. This lead to being rushed for the entire approach and being 'behind the plane'. This in turn lead to not adequately monitoring our situation that should have prompted an immediate 'go around'!
Aircraft,Approximately 5 minutes after the top of climb; the Captain noticed the green hydraulic quantity was low. I pressed the hydraulic Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor button to bring up the hydraulic page and the green system show 440 psi and a low quantity. Preemptively; we opened the Quick Reference Checklist to read over the Hydraulic Low Pressure and Low Quantity. The Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor warning went off and the captain rapidly turned off the green hydraulic pumps in accordance with the procedures. We then ran all applicable checklist en-route to ZZZ. Approximately 45 miles from ZZZ; we requested priority handling and manually extended the gear for a full stop and shut down on Runway XXR. After shut down; we were towed back to the spot.
Aircraft,Shortly after '80 knots' call on takeoff roll; I observed an amber oil pressure indication on right engine. I called out; 'Low oil pressure; right engine'. Moments later the oil pressure increased such that the indication reverted to normal white levels and I communicated that to the Captain; who was Pilot Flying. He continued the takeoff. As the initial climb progressed I continued to monitor the engine gauges and noted that the right engine oil temperature had begun increasing. I shortly thereafter noticed that right oil pressure was lower than the left side and additionally that right oil level indicated zero. I communicated this all to the Captain and we agreed that this was likely not a spurious indication.The continuing increase of oil temperature prompted us to stop the climb at 7000 ft. and set up for a possible return to the departure field. I ran the procedure for high engine oil temperature while the Captain continued to fly the aircraft. The oil temperature indications had gone amber and then red; which prompted us to shut down the engine inflight. We received delay vectors to complete all checklists and check performance data. The aircraft was above maximum landing weight but thunderstorms approaching the field prevented further fuel burn. We then completed the approach and landing and exited the Runway. Due to high indicated brake temperatures; the aircraft was stopped on the taxiway and the fire brigade was requested to inspect the undercarriage. They informed us that all looked normal. Company maintenance arrived and let us know that two tires had deflated due to melted fuse plugs. We waited aboard the aircraft while attempts to replace the tires were made. Finally; air stairs were brought to the aircraft so that we could deplane normally.
Aircraft,It was a normal operation kind of day; we got to the aircraft and starting doing our duties. Check list and tasks were being completed; just another normal flight. Taxied out to the runway and started our takeoff roll. We rotated and upon the gear up call; gear was lifted and surprised with a steering inop caution message. A few seconds later we had gotten a triple chime with a gear disagree master warning message. We turned the automation on as soon as we could and started to fly the plane. The PF (Pilot Flying) then gave the PM (Pilot Monitoring) the controls and radios while the PF began to run the QRH checklist for the gear disagree warning message. The PM then informed ATC of the event asking for delay vectors and informed ATC that they were returning to the filed after running the appropriate checklist. The PF ran through the threat and error management model and when that was completed both pilots agreed to return to ZZZ. Pilots knew that it was not a timed threat and we were landing overweight so we elected to burn off some fuel. While burning off fuel to reach our landing weight we double checked that we covered all our basis when it came to the QRH and keeping everyone informed of the event before we landed. We landed safely back in ZZZ and were met with emergency personnel and with our steering inop was towed to the maintenance ramp.I think our did a great job we communicated really well and kept a shared mental model to get the plane safely back on the ground.
Human Factors,This morning we were inbound to ZZZ on flight XXX. Weather in ZZZ was reporting 700 broken and winds were out of [the] southeast at around 8 kts. Our landing weight was approximately 152.5 and we were on the ILS [Runway] XXR with flaps 30 selected. We had pulled the weather prior to [the] start of our descent briefing and with the rain at the airport we pulled wet landing data from the ACARS system. Our REF speed was approximately 147 kts. and with the winds light there was no additive. We selected AutoBrake3 with the heavy weight and wet runway conditions and an exit at; or after [Taxiway] XX was briefed. At approximately 600ft. the runway was in sight. I declared landing and disconnected the AP/AT for landing. The aircraft felt very heavy and the controls seemed sluggish in response to input. I recall having added N1 to approximately 65 which I felt unusual at the time. As landing was being made and during the flare the stall warning went off and the aircraft seemed to fall the last 10 feet resulting in an abrupt; but not hard; landing. The aircraft did not encounter a tail strike and a normal rollout and exit at [Taxiway] XX was accomplished. Upon taxi in FO and I discussed why the horn had gone off. REF speed was a few knots above the 5 kt. add and with the wind being reported as southwesterly we ruled out a possible wind shift to a tailwind. The only conclusion I could draw out if this was that the aircraft stalled; if that's what actually happened; due to inaccurate cargo/passenger weights and the subsequent lower airspeeds resulted in a potentially dangerous situation. Pull FOQA data on the aircraft and see what actually happened compared to what I interpret happened. I also need to remember that an aircraft can stall at any time and in any configuration even if you are doing everything right. Go-around when that voice inside my head says something isn't right.
Aircraft,Aircraft X began with a report time of XA:15 local time at ZZZ with a destination of ZZZ1. Upon maintenance logbook review; two items of note were the INOP APU [for oil quantity I believe] and a #2 engine igniter INOP. These MEL items required an engine start at the gate with external air cart and a manual start for Engine #2. Aircraft was blocked with Engine 2 started at the gate under guidance from Section 7 reference material. Unable to cross bleed start in the alley the aircraft repositioned for a 'Cross bleed start' to taxi for departure. At this point the inflight called forward to inform us of a loss of all electrical power in in the cabin and trouble using the interphones. The galley power had shed and was only indicated by a note on the electrical page of the ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor).  As per procedure I made a call to Dispatch and Maintenance Control for further direction. A description of the events was given to Maintenance Control and I asked for their direction to restore the galley bus. Under direction of Maintenance Control; I reset Sec 1; 2 and 3. I am unsure why the SECs would be used for the solution; but I defer to the knowledge of MX (Maintenance) Control. I never attempted to start the remaining engine which may have cured the problem; mostly because of the trouble with interphones and the unexpected galley issues. The call to MX Control was to get help in assessment of the failures and to find an easy solution. The reset was unsuccessful and Maintenance directed me to return to gate have the local maintenance fix the problem. Which to me indicated a larger aircraft systems problem.  In the hour of troubleshooting; the customers were left without air-conditioning and the cabin reached 90 degrees with many of the customers complaining of the heat. A water service was started by the inflight.  Back at the gate Maintenance was unable to reset the galley power by normal procedures and worked on the problem for one hour. The solution was to start both engines and the INOP APU; which MX started while still on MEL [the MEL was never cleared] at the gate along with a reset of the galley bus to restore galley function. I was told push off the gate with both engines as the solution. The aircraft was boarded and customers seated so we closed up received a new release and fuel summary for block out. The flight blocked out at XB:12 local.  At push back the wheel chocks were lodged in place and unable to be moved with both engines running. The push crew advised that we needed to shut an engine down to free the chocks. I asked for Maintenance on the interphone and a MX person answered on the tug comm. I advised that shutting down may cause the same galley problem and might result in a gate return a second time. Maintenance understood and recommended the Engine 2 shut down; to free the chocks; so Engine 2 was shut down.  With the chocks free the push continued with Engine 1 running which resulted in the same situation of loss of electrical aft of the cockpit. The push was stopped at my request and the aircraft towed into the gate at XB:22 local with the same MX problem and logbook entry.  I notified Dispatch of the return and a waited for further instructions from operations. At XC:00 local I called fatigued for the flight as a departure at this point would have had an arrival time of XD:00 local in ZZZ1 and I was not safe to operate the far into the red eye period.   I was never informed that all the failures might be normal and associated with the APU inop and single engine start. If so I would have continued with the normal operation and chock the situation up to my failure to recognize the associated failures.
Aircraft,Upon gear extension during arrival; we received a nose wheel steering fault ECAM (Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor) caution. I elected to go around in order to troubleshoot. During the go around I decided to keep the gear down initially until we had time to evaluate the situation. After leveling off at go-around altitude; we consulted the QRH and attempted to reset the nose wheel steering with the n/w steering switch. The problem did not clear; and we determined it would be safe to retract the gear. We advised ATC of the steering failure and the fact that we may not be able to clear the runway under our own power. The approach and landing were accomplished successfully; and I was able to steer the aircraft clear of the runway using differential thrust and braking. After clearing the runway; we tried another reset; which was successful. We taxied to the gate with normal steering under our own power.
Aircraft,While descending through about 20;000 ft.; my FO (First Officer) and I noticed a faint odor that was quite different than previous cabin odor events that we have encountered in the past. We were both smelling a 'plastic' smell similar to what you smell when opening a box with new electronics inside. It was a clean plastic smell rather than a burning plastic smell. Because it was so different and quite faint; we both felt this was not a fume event. Upon parking at the gate; I asked the rest of the crew if they experienced anything. There was no odor in the main cabin at all. I asked them how they were feeling and they said they were fine. Because my FO and I felt fine and the event was so different; we truly were uncertain as to whether or not there was even a problem. I exited the airplane to chat with the outbound CA (Captain). She and I spent a few minutes discussing the situation. In the interest of safety; the decision was made to enter the event into the logbook.
Aircraft,We had a normal landing on Runway XX at ZZZZ. On the landing rollout I applied the brakes and slowed to taxi speed. A 180 degree turn on the runway is required due to no parallel taxiways. While executing the turn we received a FLT CTRL NO DISPATCH; EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) message. As we continued the taxi on the runway a HYD 2 LO PRESS; EICAS message presented. Shortly thereafter while exiting the runway onto Taxiway 1; I lost nose wheel steering but was able to continue the turn with the pedals and differential braking. STEER FAIL; EICAS message also presented at this time. I stopped the aircraft on Taxiway 1 and set the parking brake. We followed the HYD 2 LO PRESS QRH procedure. A view of the hydraulic synoptic page confirmed that we had lost all fluid and pressure from the Number 2 system. We advised ATC that we'd need to be towed to the gate / hardstand due to our abnormal; and that there was likely hydraulic fluid on the runway. MX (Maintenance) and Dispatch were notified and a logbook entry was made.
Human Factors,DATE. Reposition flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1; taking a good plane and 3 MX (Maintenance) personnel to a broken plane in ZZZ1. The flight was normal and uneventful until the approach. We were around 2;000 ft.; I think; and we were cleared the visual to Runway XX. I; the Captain; was Pilot Flying. I asked for Flaps 1 and we quickly received a caution EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) saying Slat Fail. We immediately asked to discontinue the approach and for delay vectors; which ATC granted. We said no assistance needed at this time. The FO (First Officer) then pulled out the QRH and ran the slat fail procedure. After returning the flaps to the previous position; the message cleared. We then talked about a plan if it were to happen again. We set up for the approach to Flaps 2; I believe; with no issue; before asking for the ILS XX. ATC gave us a vector to intercept and cleared us for the approach; which ended with a normal approach and landing.After parking; I spoke with the MX personnel that we had on board. I told them what happened and that everything operated as normal after the QRH procedure. They talked among themselves and said they believed there was no need for a write up since nothing seemed wrong and they really had nothing to go off of if everything was now operating normally. It was brought to my attention on DATE1 that that was incorrect; and that a write up should absolutely have been made. I knew I was unsure of their decision; and I should have known better. I have not really been in a situation where something was wrong; then not wrong; so I was not confident on what to do. I will keep this knowledge for future events.
Aircraft,During the arrival phase at roughly 4;000 ft. we both encountered a strong 'dirty sock' odor. It was strong for a few minutes then began to fade slightly and continued to do so until we arrived at the gate. We did not apply the odor recognition and isolation guidance given the fact that workload was high; we were being vectored for the approach and would be on the ground soon. Around 3;000 ft. the inflight crew called up front to notify us that they all smelled the odor as well. After landing I did not start the APU. After arrival at the gate and during the deplaning process I overheard a few of the deplaning passengers talking about the odor as well. I met with [maintenance] and described the situation then walked out with the whole crew. Everyone seemed fine and didn't require medical attention.
Aircraft,ZZZ to ZZZ1 flight. Upon descending at 8k I noticed a smell. Subtle. I waited a minute after closing the vents. Odor still there. I asked First Officer if he smelled something. He said yes what is that. I told him it was odor fumes and we did isolation procedure. After pack 1. Odors disappear upon landing.. At gate I asked Flight Attendants if they smelt it and the 2 in the back did.
Aircraft,Descending through 5;000 feet on approach experienced light to medium fumes. Odor also reported by all inflight with light to medium in forward galley and more severe towards aft cabin with #4 flight attendant experiencing mild burning on upper lip and mild light headedness. Event reported as lasting approximately 5 minutes then dissipating.
Aircraft,We were cruising at FL300; 50 miles north of ZZZ VOR; when we got a Cabin ALT HI warning. We ran the memory items Quick Reference Checklist; [and] asked ATC for an immediate descent to 10000 ft. [We then] ran the Quick Reference Handbook; and told ATC that we are requesting priority handling; notified the flight attendants; and prepared the cabin for landing. We requested ZZZ1 as diversion airport. It was about 100 miles from us with long runways and emergency services and proceeded there. Cabin altitude reached 10700 ft. and the masks in the back did not deploy. We landed safely; fire and rescue was on standby but once we rolled off the runway we told them we did not need any assistance. We received a gate from company operations in ZZZ1 and we parked and deplaned. Asked if everyone was ok and they said yes and we waited for operations to get another plane.
Aircraft,Everything was normal; once we took off we got in the air; I knew something wasn't right; the plane sounded differently than normal. About maybe 8 minutes later; the Captain called and said we have to go back to ZZZ because the landing gear wouldn't go up. The Captain stated that we don't need to indicate bracing signals or request priority handling. It would be about 20 minutes until we land. I said okay great land safely...made announcements to the passengers to repeat the what the Captain said; and then we landed everything was fine and everybody was safe!
Aircraft,This Part 135 passenger leg was the first leg that I flew in this particular aircraft. (The Pilot In Command and I had flown another aircraft; another tail number; for the proceeding five days of our eight day rotation.) When we received this aircraft out of maintenance; the Pilot In Command flew the first leg in this new tail number; and he commented that the elevator trim indicator (on the trim wheel) did not reflect the actual position of our elevator trim. He noted that the elevator controls did not 'feel right' on his leg; and thus; he visually inspected the actual trim location against the trim indicator position. (It is noted that the Pilot In Command is also an A&P; and he chose not to write up the issue; as he said it was 'still within limits.') It was my leg from ZZZ to ZZZ1; and I was flying from the right seat. We utilized a flap setting of 15 degrees for the takeoff; and everything seemed to feel 'normal' through the take-off roll; rotation; and climbing through 500 ft. I utilized the electric trim on my yoke; and it was uneventful until the autopilot was engaged. (It is further noted that this particular Pilot In Command was challenging to fly with; as he clearly felt that he knew much more than me and 'knew better' in general. It was also clear that he preferred to utilize certain aircraft automation on the initial climb out i.e.; 'flight level change' while I preferred to utilize 'vertical speed' on the initial climb out; yet he would engage 'flight level change' on my legs nonetheless.) Before engaging the autopilot; I set the trim appropriately for the climb out. Once the autopilot was engaged; I felt the yoke push forward. It seemed very nose-heavy and the plane descended a couple of hundred ft. The Pilot In Command said 'climb; climb'. However; the extremely nose heavy condition made the climb difficult. (It was so startling that this occurred; even though the plane was perfectly trimmed prior to autopilot engagement; that I was uncertain whether the Pilot In Command had engaged any other automation; like 'flight level change'; that could have caused this downward pitch to occur.) The alert system announced 'sink rate;' and the Pilot In Command took controls. The Pilot In Command struggled to climb the aircraft as well; and the alert system continued to announce 'sink rate.' After several seconds; the climb rate gradually improved. Our one passenger inquired about this event; as our passenger thought we were returning to the airport. (The Pilot In Command told the passenger that everything was fine; but that I was not prepared for the amount of nose-heaviness in this aircraft!) The Pilot In Command did not want to discuss this event with me; and he refused to discuss the possibility that something was mechanically deficient with the plane. The rest of the trip from ZZZ to ZZZ1 was uneventful; however; I was extremely concerned for the remainder of this rotation; as I felt that the trim rigging needed to be checked. I did not fly any additional legs in this aircraft during the remainder of the rotation.
Human Factors,Working entire final. Aircraft Y on east downwind going to Runway 35L in front of Aircraft Z doing RNAV Z to Runway 35R. Was missing pointed out traffic at 080 going into CFO and other VFR [traffic] in south vicinity of CFO. Aircraft X was on Heading 325 [degrees] to join the Runway 35L localizer.  I was waiting to issue Visual Approach clearance until I had based the Aircraft Y as that was the part of the sequence that needed to be more timely to keep the Aircraft Y in front of the Aircraft Z. I issued an approach clearance to Aircraft X and observed the aircraft altitude 9;100 ft. I knew that I had issued the aircraft 10;000 ft and wanted to make sure the pilot had the correct altimeter given it appeared the aircraft was 1;000 ft low. Pilot reported 9;100 ft and I advised pilot I had issued 10;000 ft. He advised that he read back 8;000 ft. It was a moot point at this time.  Moments later the conflict alert went off for a VFR [traffic] that was just ahead of Aircraft X. I issued a traffic alert and suggested Aircraft X stop descent as Aircraft X altitude was 8;100 ft and the VFR [traffic] indicated 7;600 ft. No response from pilot. I issued the traffic alert two more times. Then Aircraft X was now at 7;100 ft and receiving a low altitude alert so I issued a low altitude alert; then asked pilot to verify you have all the terrain in sight. He did. Then Aircraft X appeared to be intercepting the Runway 35R localizer instead of Runway 35L. I advised pilot of this and instructed him to turn left to 330 heading to join the correct localizer as the Aircraft Z was on the Runway 35R localizer. Best recommendation would be to lower the Class Bravo Airspace around Denver airport to 7;000 ft. Way too many VFR [traffic] traverse below the Class B which is underneath our four final approach courses when landing North. It is an incredibly dangerous spot for them to be and because of the proximity to APA airport there is VFR [traffic] everywhere.
Weather,I have concerns over Dispatch's flight planning; the need to burn off fuel; severe weather at ZZZ; and most importantly; poor aircraft control ability in conditions of high gusting winds; heavy weights; and short runways.WEATHER: We were operating Aircraft X from ZZZ1-ZZZ; with an alternate of ZZZ2 and alternate fuel of 2.9. Two lines of thunderstorms were headed toward ZZZ; and the METAR history was showing winds around 35-40 kts. Our planned arrival time at ZZZ was XA:15Z; and the relevant ZZZ TAF portion was:FM Date time 21022G38KT P6SM VCSH BKN040TEMPO DATE 23030G45KT 2SM TSRA OVC020CBINITIAL PLANNING: Our planned arrival fuel was X.X (alternate fuel was Z.Z). We were operating nearly full; so I knew the aircraft would be super heavy. While at the gate in ZZZ1; Dispatch indicated that they wanted to add 3;000 lbs of fuel. On the phone; I explained that I didn't want the aircraft any heavier than needed (this would make landing even more difficult); and I was not going to agree. The Dispatcher agreed to my request.Weight and balance and burning of fuel: At cruise (landing fuel was around X.X); south of ZZZ2; the FO (First Officer) and I ran initial weight and balance Landing Data for Runway XXL. It came back as invalid; indicating that we were 2;000 lbs too heavy to land. We ACARSed Dispatch; who verified the problem. The FO and I hatched a plan to descend; fly box patterns; and enter holding to burn off fuel. Running weight and balance scenarios; weight and balance only provided a positive stopping margin if landing fuel was around X.X (hence; we were 2;000 lbs too heavy). The FO and I questioned:1) How Dispatch could have wanted to add 3;000 lbs back in ZZZ1 given that we were already 2;000 lbs too heavy; and 2) How this problem arose in the first place. I believe the FO commented that the runway calculations on the release were figured using CALM winds. Again; ZZZ winds were around 35-40 kts. As we flew in circles and holding; the ride was very rough and was likely extremely uncomfortable for our Passengers. Because of the need to get landing fuel down to around A.A; this invalidated ZZZ2 as an alternate (it required fuel Z.Z); so we ACARSed Dispatch to amend the release to show ZZZ3 as an alternate (fuel Z.Z). After burning off fuel; I believe the last weight and balance we ran indicated stopping margin XXX (all other values were zero). The relevant METAR was:ZZZ Date/Time 20021G40KT 10SM BKN023 BKN060 OVC080 18/13 A2966 RMK AO2 PK WND 20040/0308 T01780128APPROACH INTO ZZZ: The FO and I briefed a go-around due to high winds. Rides were extremely rough in the descent; and we flew the RNAV-Y XXL. At 2;300 ft. AGL (3;000 ft. MSL); winds were 72 kts. At around 1;500 ft. AGL; winds were 60 kts. VTarget and VRef were 138/153. It was extremely difficult controlling airspeed; and we experienced a +15/-10 wind event; which caused a flaps 40 overspeed of 2 kts. I considered diverting to ZZZ3; but the winds were just as bad there.TOUCHDOWN: Pitch control was very difficult. Attempting to get the aircraft down at the 1;000 ft. fixed distance marker (and no further than 1;500 ft. down the runway); and at around 15 ft. AGL; I experienced a sudden right gust and the nose of the aircraft dropped quickly. I attempted to recover with aileron and elevator; but the aircraft seemed to be uncontrollable - it just 'fell' onto the runway in an attitude that I believe was a simultaneous nose wheel and right main touchdown. I believe the aircraft landed perhaps 200 ft. beyond the 1;000 ft. marker. I immediately thought to advance the thrust levers and initiate a sudden go-around; but I realized that the aircraft was on the runway; so I initiated reverse thrust to stop. I can characterize the entire touchdown as seemingly not in control.HEAVY WEIGHTS AND GUSTING WINDS: This is now the third recent landing at ZZZ in a [aircraft type] in high; gusting winds; where 1) The aircraft was not adequately controllable in the flare; and2) There was insufficient runway to 'fix it.' I believe there are major problems of 1) Gusting winds at ZZZ; which can literally be a sudden headwind/tailwind switch in the flare; 2) landing speeds that are simply too high at heavy weights and gusting winds; 3) body attitudes that are dangerously flat due to the high VRef at heavy weights and gusting winds; and 4) ZZZ runways that are too short to allow any adjustments when hit by a gust. And; I am not convinced that a go-around after touchdown in high gusting winds is safe or advisable - after the aircraft hits the runway; combined with a sudden crosswind/tailwind gust; the aircraft can lose so much energy that putting it back in the air could be disastrous. I have no idea if the aircraft will really fly or not; or what the gusting winds will do at such a low energy state; 10-20 ft. above the runway in an 'urgent' or 'emergency' go-around.
Aircraft,While on final approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ; [the] flaps did not extend past 5 when transitioning to the landing configuration. Crew executed a go-around at approximately 700 ft. and took extended vectors for an approach to Runway XXL. The flaps were extended to 15 using alternate extension procedures In Accordance With Flight Manual checklist. Upon completion of the checklist; a safe landing was conducted and [the] aircraft taxied to the gate without incident. Captain's authority was coordinated due to the flight control issue in a busy environment while receiving special handling.
Aircraft,At around XA:30 pm ZZZ time on [Gate] X I was attempting to make contact with the pilots on Aircraft X going to ZZZ to push the aircraft with an electric push tug. For about 5 minutes I couldn't hear them nor they couldn't hear me on the headset. Right before the headset issue got resolved I saw the plane roll a little and come to find out the flight crew had release brakes and cleared us to push before making contact with us. The flight crew clearing us to push before making contacting is extremely dangerous with them not knowing whether the belt loader is still up and the door open or if the crew was still disconnecting the chocks.
Company Policy,Hazmat onboard was a variety of Lithium Batteries and some CAI [Hazmat chemical]. NOTOC sheets were a mismatch of information. Some pallets on one form and not on the other. Information for pallets that visually looked exactly the same differed. One pallet was regulated but the adjacent pallet that looked exactly the same was not regulated. With no single list of items onboard we first had the issue of my inspection finding items that were not on the NOTOC I was handed but were found on a separate sheet that was prepared. I had made a list of all the pallets I found containing hazardous materials and what sort of materials they were when I came back to the flightdeck. With a lot of help from the handlers we began to unravel the confusing mix of information. None of the items were unusual but not having consistency of the labeling and listing was troubling to make sure that all items were properly boarded and documented. We also discovered that the separation guide for HAZMAT wasn't onboard. The handlers acquired a new one and brought it to the aircraft so we could figure it out.The handlers were also under the impression that Lithium Metal batteries were safer and did not pose a hazard. This is contrary to the FAA's testing where they had to stop Lithium Metal battery fire test prior to the planned time due to the safety of the test aircraft they were using. Additionally; the handlers didn't seem stressed over safety; only the departure time. There was only pointing to our policy of not requiring some Lithium batteries to be listed as the fix for everything. Once we were able to get the multiple sheets together we worked through my list of pallets and then were able to determine they were listed. The pallets that were visually the same were still able to be carried in either case and no difference could be ascertained without unloading and tearing off the covering of the pallets.The cause of this appears to be based more in the non standard regulations and company policy towards Lithium batteries. They all pose a hazard and as we saw in the [previous] incident; even the batteries contained in devices can have disastrous results. It seems that the company policy only complicates the issue by not consistently requiring all Lithium Battery shipments to be listed. Even if they have the note that they are non regulated it alleviates the concerns while ensuring the crew is notified and prepared in the event of a fire. I'm very comfortable with the regulations around Hazmat and try to stay up to date. This wasn't a lack of knowledge on my part but a lack of clear information being provided.Create a single policy for shipment of Lithium Batteries and Hazardous materials in general requiring them to all be listed on a single NOTOC. I would further recommend that the system be developed so that all materials contained on a single pallet will be listed in grouped sections. Preferably we could further extend this so that the listings are all based on position in the aircraft; nose to tail; top to bottom so we can more easily assess a situation in flight if it would develop.
Ambiguous,I had to call in sick for my trip on Date; and throughout this report I want to expand on why I made that call.The reason for my sick call was fatigue; to the point that I didn't feel fit to fly for the above-mentioned trip. I believe long hours of working caught up on me and made me more tired than I normally am after my trip.In the past 365 days; I accumulated 967:XX hrs. of block time and many times I went above 990 in the past few weeks. If it wasn't for a couple of conversion from active flying to deadhead; I believe the 1;000 hrs. limit would have been reached. (In the past 28 days I have deadheaded for 14 hrs:XXmin and blocked for 79:XX [hrs]. If I flew the above scheduled trip; the total block could have been close to about 90 hours)Even though few flying picked up by desire here and there; (crew to crew; and mainly to help out colleagues with immediate family needs) scheduling pressure at our airline has never been as high as it has been recently. Long stretch of working days back-to-back; minimum days off; inefficient days with long seats around the airport; and lack of scheduling flexibility is the common issue among my peers these days.As an example; over the holiday I worked 7 days in a row; (a 3 day and a 4 day) and it was legal only because we had 30 hrs. of layover on my 3-day trip. First day of that trip was scheduled to fly X international legs with a block hour of 8:XX which included almost 3 hrs. of seat at ZZZ [airport]. The whole trip worth around 14 hrs. for 3 day and still don't know why that trip scheduled to be so packed and close to FAR 117 limits.There have been many months in the past year that I didn't intend to fly as many hours as I did; but the way schedules are being assigned; you try to pick up something with the hope that it brings your monthly credit high enough so that you can drop another trip; but most of the time last minute changes in crew availability makes you work all the extra trips you picked up. Even at times when the reserve coverage looked good; there are so guidelines restricting us from making any safety adjustments to our schedule.Hopefully my report cast some light on my sick call due to fatigue; and hopefully our cumulative effort brings positive changes to our work rules; eventually making it a better; safer; and healthier place to work. Appreciate if this report and other similar report result in any kind of improvement in our scheduling system.
Procedure,It was the first flight of the day. As I was doing my walk around; I noticed fluid dripping out of the number 1 engine drain. It was dripping approximately once every 10 seconds; and smelled like diesel so I assumed it was Jet A. I then informed the Captain; and he promptly called maintenance. Maintenance seemed to indicate it was not a big deal. They told us to run up the engine at the gate for 2 minutes while monitoring the drip; and that unless the dripping exceeded 100 drops per min we could continue the flight. The Captain and I looked through the Quick Reference Handbook and the GRG (Ground Rest Guide) to see if there was any guidance for the procedure; but found none. We briefed what we would each do; how we would proceed; and coordinated with operations. We then accomplished the engine start and run up with no problems; and the drip stopped as soon as the engine started.We finished the rest of the flight with no issues. Once we landed in ZZZ; the Captain decided to call maintenance again. He wanted to make a write up so that there was a paper trail if the drip ever occurred again. The second maintenance guy also indicated that it was not a big deal and that a write up was not necessary. The Captain told him that he was going to write it up anyway; so they decided to make an Info Only entry. We assumed the issue was resolved and completed the rest of the trip in the same plane uneventfully.Five days later I received a call from the Chief Pilot. She informed me that the engine start at the gate is a procedure we; as pilots; are not allowed to perform. Maintenance had steered us wrong and that they should have come out to the plane to address the problem. In retrospect; when we were unable to find the procedure in our literature; we should have consulted with another maintenance representative or another party (Job Card supplement; Flight Ops; etc.) to verify the information we were receiving. As a fairly new First Officer; this is has been hugely informative for me. Going forward; I will no longer blindly trust anyone when it comes to performing my job; even other departments within the company.I think that in order to prevent this from occurring in the future that a few things could be done. The pilot group should be reminded that maintenance can make mistakes and that if we are unable to find the procedure in our literature; they should seek further advice from another source. Secondly; maintenance; especially new employees; should be reminded that the pilot group puts a lot of trust in them; and that they should be certain that what they are recommending is within our capabilities and procedures.
Aircraft,I was working Aircraft X to ZZZ and it had seemed to be like any other flight; until I noticed that the Sterile light hadn't gone off after a while. The Captain had called through the normal Pilot button on the inter phone and informed me that the landing gear wouldn't go up and that we would have to go back to ZZZ1. I didn't think much of it because he didn't make it seem like [he was requesting landing priority]. I had told him that he should be the one to tell the passengers what the problem was so that I wouldn't misinform them of the situation. We keep going for a while and then I get a call on the normal Pilot button and the Captain said that we're going back to ZZZ1 now.Probably 10-15 minutes later; I hear the 2 high/low chimes go off so I know we have a little while before we land. Upon hearing those chimes; the passengers started looking at me with concern and wonder in their eyes because it had been a while since the Captain told them that we were going back to ZZZ1. I didn't know much information except for that we were going back because of the landing gear; so I told the passengers that we would be landing soon; to keep their seat belts fastened; and that we would fix the problem and then get them on their way to ZZZ. We deplane and the maintenance guys come on and then they said that someone wanted to talk to me. A Gate Agent came on and asked if I did any immediate cabin preparation. I told him I'm not sure and to ask my Captain. He said no; did you do any [priority] prep and I said no; because I didn't even know that it was an urgent situation. The crew gets off because we're plane swapping and that's when the Captain says that yeah it was an urgent situation and I didn't really give you a proper Brief.
Procedure,On the night of DATE the ZZZ EBU (Engine Build Up) crew required additional lubricant referred to as Molykote G-N Assembly Paste in Engineering Authorization X rev I. After referencing Aircraft Maintenance Manual; it was determined that we had not been using the lubricant called out for in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual. Engineering has since verified that the Lubricant p/n DCGNK listed in the Engineering Authorization (full document) has been no longer approved for this task. The correct lubricant was not set up in our parts system and an ECRA (Engineering Change Request Authorization) generated to create an M&E number to start the process of procuring the correct lubricant. A couple of concerning issues are [the] Company did not discontinue the scheduling of these tasks except for ZZZ after an aircraft was deferred in lieu of performing the job without the required lubricant. A review of logs indicated other stations were still performing the task. To date the system is not set up with the correct lubricant and some of the stations show zero quantity of an aerosol spray that supposedly; can be used as a non-preferred application method. Not only non-preferred but also pointed out to local management near impossible to get the coating thickness requirements met on the required areas of the Fan Disk (pressure faces of the dove tail and the Booster Spool face where the blade dovetail contacts). While the Engineering Authorization is specific to which form of lubricant to use; the use of the non-preferred method; aerosol spray raises safety and health issues especially as most of these tasks are performed in an uncontrolled environment prohibiting suitable precautions to be taken. This; in addition to the quality consideration of the work accomplished.
Human Factors,Hidden Dangerous GoodsDuring security screening of passengers baggage the TSA discovered a container of fiberglass resin.The container was removed by the TSA and the customer was notified.
Aircraft,Aircraft X; ZZZ to ZZZ1; immediately after level off at FL 390; experienced an audible and visible electrical swap; followed by loss of multiple displays; lights; and multiple Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor cautions. Autopilot 2; Auto Thrust; First Officer Primary Flight Display; Navigation Display; and lower Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor were all failed. I took controls and Comms while First Officer commenced Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor actions. Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitors displayed in order: Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio Mode fault; AC Bus 2 fail; DC Bus 2 fail; Gen 2 fault; NAV LS tuning disagree. I engaged Auto Pilot 1; while manually adjusting thrust. I performed a radio check with ATC and informed them we were dealing with an electrical fault; however no assistance was required. Lead Flight Attendant called to inform us all power and lights were out in the cabin.When [the] First Officer performed Gen 2 fault Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor; the Gen Reset; and we regained AC and DC bus 2. We realized then we had experienced a Gen 2 Trip and the Bus Tie had not worked; resulting in the loss of two main busses. The Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio MODE fault did not clear. We attempted the published FM reset for this malfunction and it did not work. With [the] situation stabilized; First Officer took controls back; and we agreed to descend to FL 310 per FM guidance to improve APU start capability. I contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control while [the] First Officer coordinated altitude change for APU start.At this point Gen 2 failed again; however; this time; the bus tie operated correctly and we did not lose AC and DC bus2. Gen 1 powered all busses except normal galley shed. Reset of Gen 2 did not work this time. The First Officer descended to FL310 and started the APU. Bus tie worked and APU Gen successfully powered right side of electrical system. First Officer climbed aircraft back to FL350 to exit a layer of IMC at FL310. Finally able to consult with Maintenance Control after the latest Gen fault; they confirmed from their report downloads what we assessed from all of the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor cautions.They asked us to attempt another reset of the Eng 2 Engine Pressure Ratio mode; which was unsuccessful. We operated the remainder of the flight with both engines in N1 degraded mode. Maintenance Control opined that; although the electrical system was currently powered; there were questions about the efficacy of the bus tie system; and any subsequent potential electrical faults made it prudent to not continue flight to ZZZ1; but rather stop short. Flight crew and Dispatch agreed. Dispatch mentioned ZZZ2; which we had just passed. First Officer and I felt it was just as safe to continue to ZZZ3.By the time we could perform all of our briefs and planning we we would be descending to ZZZ3 and we were about 45 [to] 50 minutes away. The weather was good; and it would be better for our passengers and maintenance. Maintenance Control and Dispatch agreed that a divert to ZZZ3 was a great option. I took the controls back; the First Officer coordinated clearance to ZZZ3 via the ZZZZZ arrival. We did not request priority. We conducted a visual approach and uneventful landing to Runway XXC at ZZZ3.
Human Factors,On descent into ZZZ and proceeding to ZZZZZ on the RNAV (GPS) Runway XX approach; ATC gave us a descent to 8000 which I set in the Mode Control Panel (MCP) altitude window. The Flying Pilot indicated that the altitude was actually 7000 and without checking a ATC; I reset the MCP window. We continued the descent below 8000 in VMC; got a terrain warning immediately followed by ATC correcting our altitude back to 8000. I reset the MCP to 8000 and we climbed back up to the correct altitude. A normal approach and landing followed.
Aircraft,Winds at 9;000 ft. were out of the southwest at 125 kts. CVG weather was marginal with gusty winds out of the West. The NOTAMs for ILS27 included alternate missed approach instructions which we used to edit the FMC. We were to climb to 2;000 ft. and turn left to FLM for holding at 3;000 ft. We briefed and talked about this difference which would most likely set us up for vectors from the south of the field. We were vectored for ILS27; holding 170 kts. until the marker. Configuration was F20 gear up. I held off on gear extension until glide slope capture which put our landing flap selection close to '1;000 ft. stable' threshold. I remember thinking that we had about 600 ft. for the flaps to move into position and complete the landing checklist. The remaining items of the event seemed compressed in time. Flaps were selected 25; speed brakes armed and landing checklist complete; and speed bug set for a wind correction of 161 kts. Just prior to 1;000 ft. an amber line strike out the GS pitch FMA. Shortly after the pitch bar on the FD biased out of view and EICAS message AUTOPILOT appeared. The raw data glideslope was missing.I do not believe that the Land 3 FMA annunciation changed; or at the least we didn't get a No AUTOLAND annunciation. My initial thought was that we were in an attitude stabilizing mode as there was a Aircraft Y in position on the runway. We then got a GPWS 'glideslope' aural alert in IMC flight conditions. I called and executed an immediate Go Around. Initial Tower instructions had us fly 290 heading and climb 3;000 ft. We were then given right turn to 360 when able and climb 4;000 ft. Starting the missed approach at 1;000 ft. AGL; 2;000 ft. MSL put us close to level off at 3;000 ft. and I recognized and compensated for this by holding the power levers from going full forward. Still the high rate at which the event took place coupled with hand flying; trying to get back to a place that we could re-automate; and accomplishing the go-around procedure while communicating with ATC made for a busy flight deck environment. We were able to engage the autopilot with the aircraft trimmed for the current flight path with about 1;000 ft. before leveling at 4;000 ft. I noticed that we were approaching 4;000 ft. with too much momentum and again manually decreased the thrust lever position. It didn't seem like the autopilot was going to even attempt a level off; much different than not exceeding a 1G level off; it was not pushing over much at all. I disconnected the autopilot and decreased the thrust levers to near idle as I attempted a manual level off but we were already climbing through our assigned altitude. The PM (Pilot Monitoring) called Tower telling them that we were not able 4;000 ft. and that we were already through the altitude. Tower immediately cleared us to 5;000 ft. which was uneventful.I believe that we were probable at around 4;300 ft. before the planes flight path was beginning to descend. We cleaned the aircraft to flaps 10 and 190 kts. due to the strong winds. We discussed the possibility of 5G interference with the glide slope as it wasn't a temporary fluctuation as you would expect with an aircraft in the critical area. I briefed and we discussed what the procedure would be if we encountered the same issues with the glide slope and how we could reconfigure for an IAN (Integrated Approach Navigation) approach. The second approach was uneventful with all systems working normally. ATC reported that the preceding aircraft reported no anomalies with the glideslope.Maintenance log reported Autopilot Caution and FD Bar Bias with ILS BEAM ERROR (FCC) 'NO ACTION REQUIRED'. I needed to focus more on the aircraft during the missed approach so as to anticipate the failed level off by the automation. The missed approach was a very busy time which was compounded by ATC changing headings and altitudes verses what was expected.
Aircraft,The weather at CLT was IFR. The ceiling was reported at 900 AGL visibility was 10 NM or greater. Once we were established on the final approach segment; I selected AIII for the approach guidance in the HUD. I briefed the First Officer (FO) that I was using the AIII Mode for proficiency and since I anticipated VMC conditions below the reported ceiling; we would monitor the approach guidance and HAP panel but only execute a missed approach if we were not stable. We broke out about 1200 AGL and proceeded in VMC conditions. At approximately 600 AGL I got an 'APPROCH WARN' flashing in the HUD. The FO confirmed the same on the HAP panel. Since we were in VMC conditions; fully configured and stable; I told the FO we would proceed to a landing. We landed uneventfully. Upon clearing the runway; I reported to the Ground Controller I felt we may have experienced 5G interference on short final. Upon arrival at the gate; I made an entry in the log regarding the anomaly and reported the entry to CLT station maintenance. The airplane was taken out of service for another issue and we swapped airplanes. Continued monitoring of the potential for 5G interference is crucial going forward. Had the conditions required an actual CAT III approach; we would have been compelled to execute a missed approach and may have been forced to proceed to our alternate.
Aircraft,During descent Internal Reference System fault light on right Internal Reference System. Speed Trim Fail light. Electrical smell order. Requested priority handling. Had Airport Rescue and Firefighting inspect aircraft for fire and smoke. Taxied to gate.
Human Factors,During boarding crew chief brought Dangerous Goods Form to flight deck.  We send ACARS message and received printed ACARS receipt. Just prior to departure I was informed by Crew Chief that Dangerous Goods Form item wasn't loaded but we never received the required ACARS auto[form] notification of item not loaded.  I called Dispatch/Loads asking them if they received information hazardous material wasn't loaded and they said no. We received load closeout prior to gate showing no restricted articles.  So instead of causing unnecessary delays I elected to proceed to ZZZ1 with just verbal and closeout confirmation of no hazardous materialsI felt it wasn't my responsibility to try and teach/correct Crew Chief's hazardous material procedures since they are primarily responsible   Since this is a new change with electronic [form]s ; the people responsible should review procedures for correct compliance.
Ambiguous,Our preflight and taxi out was normal. Weather was nice and winds were calm. I was PF (Pilot Flying) and the takeoff roll was normal; following an Airbus 321. After rotation; the FO (First Officer) called out 'positive rate' and I responded with 'gear up'. Right when he put the gear level up; we encountered the wake of the aircraft in front of us. We were at a normal pitch attitude of about 12 degrees of pitch at the time of encountering the wake. The aircraft then pitched up a degree or two and banked to the left at the same time. Right when it happened the aural warning of the stick pusher sounded; stick shaker started and stick pusher engaged all at the same time for about 1 second. It pushed us down about a degree or two of pitch then kicked off. I continued pitching down until about 10 degrees and monitored our airspeed which was about 165 KIAS and increasing. We then made sure the aircraft was flying normally and continued cleaning it up and the rest of the flight was uneventful.Wake turbulence causing stick pusher event.
Chart Or Publication,Departing [Runway] 26 at Hilo; there is a single-engine procedure due to terrain which requires a turn below 1;000 feet AGL. This is noted on the TLR (Takeoff/Landing Report); but there is no associated Jepp eng-out page in my FD-PRO. I may be incorrect; but I believe there should be a chart in FD-PRO.
Aircraft,After gear attraction on takeoff landing gear air disagree message displayed on Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System. Message went away and then shortly after came back. Preformed Quick Reference Handbook and communicated with dispatch and decided it was best to continue to ZZZ. [Requested priority handling] and landed in ZZZ. The message persisted but during landing we did have thrust reversers and the plane acted normal even though the message persisted. Upon stopping deemed that the steering was still working and the aircraft was safe to taxi into the gate. We arrived at the gate without further issues.
Aircraft,After both engines [were] shut down; we turned on the APU bleed to power the packs to cool [the] plane. Shortly thereafter; flight attendant said there was what appeared to be electrical smell and smoke in [the] cabin. Smoke was visible.We immediately turned off the APU; as the event seemed to have started when APU bleed was turned off. Also had FA's open rear doors; opened Flight Deck windows to create draft and dissipate smoke. Smoke did indeed dissipate. Once all passengers were deplaned; we turned on APU Bleed again; smoke immediately reappeared and was visible coming out of Flight Deck vents. Shut down APU and contacted Maintenance.
Aircraft,APU inop due to previous crew having fumes event within the previous 2 hours of us receiving the aircraft. Performed external air start checklist with APU deferred. After number 2 engine start and packs on per checklist; we could smell a hint of oil smell right away. With the crossbleed in auto and engine 2 bleed on with both packs on; the crossbleed valve would not open to supply pack My First Officer moved the crossbleed valve to open to verify that the valve would open. At that point; the crossbleed valve opened and we immediately smelled [a] very strong oil smell. Eyes burning; [I] could taste it. Immediately he put the crossbleed valve back to Auto and we went on oxygen and returned to the gate.
Airspace Structure,Terrain caution on ZZZ Runway XX. GPWS alert level 'Caution' Terrain Proximity; Landing Event.
Weather,In cruise flight at 40;000 ft and 0.88 Mach talking to JAX Center approxamitely area of CHRGE intersection over the Gulf of Mexico. Center had been fielding requests from many aircraft about diverting for storms and turbulence; predominantly below us. We were a few thousand feet above a smoothish undercast layer of clouds; with a higher cloud area of blow off some 30ish miles to the south of our course. We were experiencing continuous light turbulence with occasional moderate for about 10 minutes. At one point we began to see wisps of moisture rising from the mostly smooth layer in sort of a line perpendicular to our route. We requested 43;000 ft to see if we could get up a little higher. ATC advised us that Aircraft Y; 12 miles in front of us; had just reported severe turbulence at 43;000 ft while all reports from 39;000 ft to 41;000 ft indicated only moderate turbulence. We chose to stay at 40;000 ft.As we crossed some line; the turbulence had increased significantly; and the autopilot was struggling to keep the wings level. Turbulence increased even more with the autopilot somewhat falling behind on maintaining control. I noticed at one point our altitude had dipped to as low as 39;200ft while the airspeed was dropping quickly; trending slower than 0.81 Mach. I added power; to stem the airspeed loss; while the turbulence increased. At some point the autopilot disconnected and I manually tried to just keep the plane in a wings and nose level attitude. Seconds later Pilot Monitoring (PM) noticed the airplane was climbing rapidly while the airspeed was also accelerating well into the red overspeed zone; probably as high as 0.95 or 0.96 Mach. There were several aural warning sounds going off; (autopilot; overspeed; CAS messages; etc) When the turbulence subsided; it became very smooth quickly and we were at an altitude of 40;800 ft. At some point we had notified ATC of our inability to maintain altitude and they had cleared us for a block; but I couldn't hear the specific altitudes through all the aural warnings. We descended to 40;000 ft and continued the flight. The entire episode of Severe turbulence probably lasted no more than 20 to 25 seconds. We originally reported the incident to ATC as moderate turbulence. In the next few minutes we re-reported the turbulence to ATC as severe after verifying the delineations between the categories of turbulence. Severe up and downdrafts associated with severe turbulence.
Aircraft,I was pilot flying from ZZZ to ZZZ1.  We were cleared for the visual Runway XX into ZZZ1.  We were around 8 miles from the final approach fix for the ILS XX and I armed LOC.  Shortly after I called for flaps 1 and we received TE FLAP DISAGREE Electronic Indicating and Crew Alerting System message.  We were close to intercepting LOC at this point around 3000 ft.  We decided to intercept the LOC.  The Pilot Monitoring let ATC know that we had a problem and that we needed to discontinue the approach.  ATC Then provided us vectors to keep us near the airport.  The Pilot Monitoring let ATC know that we needed some time to complete our checklists and we would let them know when we were finished.  The Pilot Monitoring located the TE FLAP DISAGREE checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook and ran that checklist which directed the Pilot Monitoring to the TE FLAP ASYMMETRY checklist.  The Pilot Monitoring then ran and completed that checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook.  The landing distance determined in the Quick Reference Handbook was sufficient to continue and land on the same Runway (XX) in ZZZ1.  We decided that since this was a non-normal configuration and a higher than normal approach that we would request priority handling and have Crash Fire Rescue standing by as a precaution in case we had hot brakes after landing.  Priority handling was requested and we were vectored around for another visual Runway XX.  We landed; taxied back to the gate safely and completed the flight with no other issues.
Aircraft,Rejected Take-Off for Integrated Drive Generator 1 Caution Message. During take-off; after pushing thrust levers forward; Integrated Drive Generator 1 Caution Message and associated GEN 1 Caution message. Take-off was rejected at low enough airspeed that airspeed never registered. Followed Quick Reference Handbook; returned to gate.
Aircraft,After holding short of Runway XXR at taxiway 1 for some time we were cleared for take-off. Upon lining up on the center line and being transferred flight controls; I advanced the thrust levers to take-off thrust. Before I was able to say; 'Check Thrust' a master warning sounded and the Captain and I both noticed a 'Stall Protection System 2 FAIL' red Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System message as well as an additional caution message; both of which quickly disappeared by themselves. At about 15 kts. we assumed the reject duties; the Captain took controls and I pressed the yoke forward and let ATC know we were rejecting and needed to taxi-off. We exited the runway and called Maintenance who requested we return to the gate. We taxied back where the fault was signed off. The subsequent take-off was successful with no abnormalities. The gusty winds we think unevenly moved the position of the Angle of Attack sensors which likely caused the issue. Perhaps more routine checks of the Angle of Attack sensors when windy conditions exist.
Weather,Initially on course to ZZZ; we made a deviation around convective activity; approximately 30 miles to the south just after passing ZZZZZ. After clearing the weather; we determined that we were safe to continue direct to ZZZ2 [VOR]. After entering IMC; we had started picking up light chop; we dialed the speed back to turbulence penetration speed just in case of any worsening conditions. There were no reports of any adverse ride conditions; or convective activity in our path according to ATC. With the radar about 0.5 degrees down; It was not painting anything insidious or anything to raise any alarms; so we continued; as the most we saw was a little bit of radar return in GREEN. After. Entering IMC; we encountered severe turbulence; which lasted approximately 90 seconds. We lost around 800 feet; uncontrolled bank around 45 degrees; and an over speed of around 10 kts. After stabilizing the aircraft; immediate notification was made to ATC; and we assessed the situation in the cabin. After speaking to the flight attendants; and understanding the state of the passengers; it was determined that the best course of action was to execute a diversion to the nearest suitable airport; which was ZZZ1. We made a successful diversion to ZZZ1. After getting into the gate and dealing with the maintenance issues; we then realized that we had done an overweight landing; approximately 1000 lbs overweight. The touchdown was smooth; no hard landing occurred.
Procedure,FO's (First Officer) leg; but on the ground taxiing; so I as Captain was PF (Pilot Flying). Pushed back from the gate; de-iced; anti-iced; started engines; and began taxiing. During taxi; we got an ECAM message of high EGT on engine 1. Stopped the aircraft; checked the EGT; high 600s and climbing. Shut down the engine and returned to the gate. Informed the passengers and Flight Attendants. Called Dispatch and Maintenance Control. Maintenance checked their data and said the EGT was over limit for 15 seconds; and peaked at 788 Degrees C. My initial concern was that the de-icing crew had not completely cleared the engine inlet. Now my concern is that maybe we didn't have the engine anti-ice on. It seems unlikely that we wouldn't have turned it on. We talked about the icing conditions; the Anti-Ice ON; the de-icing; anti-icing; taxiway conditions; etc. But now I can't say with 100% certainty that we did.Taxiway conditions were okay; but not great. Snow over some ice. When we got the chime; my first action was to stop the aircraft and set the parking brake; verify the parking brake; and no aircraft movement. Only then did I look at the ECAM to see what the issue was. I'm sure this prolonged the time over the EGT limit. The other thing that initially confused us; and led to a couple of extra seconds over the limit; was the message itself. >ENG 1 EGT high. >IF unsuccessful: >Engine Master switch off. Our question: 'If WHAT is unsuccessful?' Must be to reduce thrust; but it's already at idle. Let's shut it down.
Aircraft,Climbing out of 14;000 [ft.] we encountered an extremely strong fumes event. The musty smell was overpowering and we immediately donned our oxygen masks. The FA's then called up and said they had the same strong odor throughout the whole cabin. The copilot and myself discussed our options and [requested special handling]. We decided to divert to ZZZ as it was the closest airport to us that we felt we could accomplish our tasks and land. Fire crews were requested to make sure there was nothing burning on the outside of the aircraft as the FA's at first told us it smelled like something was burning and later clarified it was a musty smell. Once at the gate ; the smell still had not dissipated.Weather was low ceilings and heavy rain. Crew communicated well and coordinated for a successful landing.
Aircraft,The flight from ZZZ1-ZZZ was uneventful until on approach into ZZZ for ILS XXR at flaps 20. We received a FLAPS FAIL Caution message when we selected flaps 30 at around 175 kts. Flaps were stuck in the 20 position. The FO (First Officer) was flying and I elected to have him level off at 3000 and asked for runway heading then advised ATC of our problem. He flew runway heading and we got vectors back around for our next approach while I have ran the QRH for our FLAP FAIL. We requested priority handling and had the trucks standing by as a precaution due to our increased approach speed. ATC gave us vectors back around for the longer Runway XXL as we requested. Ran through all of our QRH procedures and checklists then advised the FA (Flight Attendant) and Passengers of our situation. Once that was all compete; we shot the ILS XXL approach back into ZZZ and landed flaps 20 without incident.
Aircraft,Aircraft had MEL 34-XX-X and MEL 34-XX-Y. ATL was conducting ILS Runway 26R. I was flying had nav1 signal for LOC 1 with IGXZ on PDF. The LOC became intermittent working and red flag in VMC conditions. Corrected each time but was vectored around for another approach. During this apprise the FO (First Officer) NAV 2 LOC was working. Briefed the changes due to FO will be flying now. When cleared for approach the Flight Director failed and came back. Still VMC and then the FO nav 2 loc 2 went red with red loc flag; which went back to green. Told ATC again there was a problem. Low on fuel we diverted to ZZZ. Discussed with Dispatch. Landed with 1;600 lbs. ATL Approach was very helpful and understanding. Loss of reliability with navigation NAV 1 and NAV 2.
Aircraft,Date; we were told to air return to ZZZ due to a malfunction of our pitot/static heat system. Due to the predicted weather at our destination and the snowy and icing possibility; the company did not want us to continue on that airplane. We coordinated with Dispatch and ATC to make sure that we as the crew was making the best decision in the interest of the passengers; company; and future operations. We landed normally and resumed normal operations. Due to the aircraft systems logic; the probes begin to power at full heat at weight off wheels. After rotation is when the heat was applied to the probes and that moment is when the malfunction occurred during our departure. I don't believe we could have known about that malfunction before the weight off wheels moment.I believe events like this are uncontrollable due to the logic of the system. Some systems activate at the weight off wheels moment regardless of switch position.
Aircraft,During the take off roll; smelt strong fumes; did not smell like sweet deicing fluid. Aborted takeoff at about 90kts. Got the trucks to inspect the aircraft and returned to gate. Unknown electrical issue.
Aircraft,After getting de-iced in ZZZZ we taxied for a Runway XXL departure. After takeoff roll at approximately 85-90 knots; the crew smelled a strong electrical fume odor in the flight deck. Considering the fact of the smell from the de-icing fluid; it was determined to be unrelated and the Captain called for a rejected takeoff. We cleared the runway with plenty of runway remaining and notified Tower of [the] situation and requested fire trucks to meet us as a safety precaution. After being checked out by crash/rescue we were escorted back to [the] gate and contacted Maintenance to further investigate the cause.
Aircraft,On takeoff at approximately 90-100 knots; I felt a pressure bump and noticed the L Pack light on overhead. Captain called 'continue' and proceeded with a normal takeoff. After T/O we completed the L Bleed Off QRH checklist. When bleed did not reset; maintenance and dispatch were brought into the loop. ATC made the decision they wanted us to return to ZZZ for operational reasons. We dumped 53;700 lbs of fuel while preparing for our return to ZZZ. We consulted the Quick Reference Guide diversion guide and completed all checklists on arrival into ZZZ. A normal landing was accomplished and taxied to the gate uneventfully.
Weather,Upon coasting in over the West Coast we had numerous Pireps shared on our frequency of moderate turbulence. A Company flight reported a +/- 20 knot wind shift at FL350. That alerted us along with information from WSI that we were about to enter an area of turbulence. Instead of waiting for us to encounter to make the commands over the PA to be seated; I called FA (Flight Attendants) at Door 1 using the interphone. I alerted her that we were entering an area of moderate turbulence that based on information would last about 20 minutes or so and for her to share with the other FA's to take precaution and be seated until we got east of the reported area. I repeated myself twice to make she understood while FA was listening in.East of JAGWA we encountered Severe Turbulence that lasted about 30 seconds. XX 14 first had to flight idle and deploy full speed brake to avoid over speeding. We then encountered a loss of 35 kts. while at max power and speed brake stowed. This all while encountering severe turbulence. Once things settle down; I notified ATC followed by asking the FA's to check in. Via the inter phone I got confirmation that they were all ok. I asked them to check the Cabin to confirm that all passengers were ok. I was notified that a Gentleman had to throw up in the Lavatory at door 2; other than that all passengers were ok and most importantly that we had no injuries to passengers nor crew! We continued our flight to our destination.
Weather,Too many threats to count. Blizzard; LLWS; maintenance; delays; looking forward to a max duty day; proficiency; 2 jumpseaters.Weather was winter-nasty in ZZZ. Jet was a bit late arriving from ZZZ1. Weather enroute to ZZZ2 was a fast moving strong front. We were already delayed before we left hotel; but arrived as scheduled to airport. Upon arrival at jet we received ACARS EDCT mssg. Overall late from schedule by about XA:30. On preflight we discussed clutter; deicing; LLWS. Considering conditions we decided to use F5 instead of a higher flap setting. It was a Max Thr light jet and we discussed the differences between flap settings for clutter ¼' slush; and LLWS. I was concerned with ovsd the flaps on a MAX TH climb out so we went with F5. Most of slush was at far end of Runway XXC. Any delayed rotation for LLWS would put us in the slush; so that was the decision matrix. Also planned to call for FLCH at 800 ft. AGL due to a low level off of 3000 ft. MSL. Maintenance-wise; we had INOP RT IRS so FO (First Officer) had some switches to put in non-normal positions. Also; no Wi-Fi so we knew we would have to go old-school for the [storm] mitigation in ZZZ2. Otherwise; Preflight was normal. We ran all checklists and called for push. Just as 2nd engine was starting a RUDDER RATIO EICAS came up. Entered ELB entry and FO called ZZZ Maintenance then looked up malf in QRH. I referenced the MEL to see what might be deferrable. A RUDDER RATIO EICAS isn't deferrable. Either way; Maintenance came on VHF 2 and had us reset about 8 CBs. Took a while; but EICAS finally cleared. We called for further taxi to Deice pad. While deicing we talked about weather conditions; LLWS; light weight; MAX TH again. We were good to go. Finished deicing; ran all checklists again to make sure everything was setup properly. Took it slow to set the tone. Also; to give me a few extra minutes of brain time. I'm returning to the [aircraft type 2] after 18 months from [aircraft type 1] Captain on reserve. I hardly flew at all in Year. I was/am not very proficient from a flying standpoint. Here we go... Short taxi from Deice pad to Runway XXC. Only a few departures ahead of us. No PIREPS from Tower. We held short to send the FO back to check the wings. They were using Type 1 in the pad; and the HOT had already expired before they even finished spraying. At this point the Vis was about ¾ miles and very light snow; not really an issue. He came back; reported All Good; and we finished checklist; called Ready. Lined up well on centerline; cleared for Takeoff. Power up to MAX. Wind was something like 340/19G33 and I was impressed with how well I stayed on CL. Rotated on speed. About 800 ft. we started to encounter moderate thunderstorms. I called for FLCH CMS. Ride was really rough and AS was jumping around but manageable. Called for flaps as soon as I could. The FO commented ALT CAP pretty much as soon as he pressed FLCH; about 900 ft. AGL. With MAX THR we were climbing aggressively. Flaps came up; slowly. At the F1 call; about 2000 ft.; the thrust; which was back near idle; came out of my hand and went to CLB THR. AT were still engaged; but I pulled them back to keep from overspending the flaps. AS jumped from CMS 223 to bottom of redline; 250 for FL1. I held the throttles back as I was attempting to level off at 3000 ft. Flaps came up and there was no overspeed. It was extremely difficult to hold AS and ALT in the turbulence. It was probably severe. But what was way more difficult to manage were the Autothrottles. They kept wanting to go to CLB. At this point I was fighting the AS and ALT in the turbulence and the AT. My scan had reduced to a pinhole; concentrating on the very basics; so I wasn't watching FMAs. Way too dynamic here. I finally disconnected the AT; engaged the C AP; then engaged the AT. AS was probably 300 by now. Immediately the AT went to CLB. TB still probably Severe. Clicked everything off again and finally was able to recover at 4000 ft.; 1000 ft. high; and maybe 320 KIAS. Thunderstorm was moderate by now but not near as bad as before. I had FO [advised ATC] now. He stated we were having difficulty maintaining alt and AS. ATC asked if we needed assistance or if we were returning to ZZZ. At this point the jet was becoming more manageable. We then told them we were ready to continue to destination. We rescinded the [priority handling] and continued to ZZZ2. Enroute we all discussed what happened and what we saw. We came to the conclusion that it was a horizontal Windshear-type event. But none of us could figure out why the jet was calling for CLB THR. There were never any overspeed warnings or stick shakers; but FO noted he saw a FLAP LIMIT FMA. I didn't see a single FMA as I was trying just to keep the plane upright. At that point in the climb from F1 to flaps up the speed was getting most of my attention; and I kept it out of the red. FO and I are convinced the FMC was programmed properly. Upon arrival in ZZZ2 we had ZZZ2 Maintenance do an AT test and nothing came up. That solidified our wind shear call. There were no Cautions or Warnings and no Windshear callouts. Looking back; it was very startling. Happened very quickly. Max thrust climb in a light jet; blizzard; slush; LLWS; poss severe turbulence; proficiency: it all added up. During debrief we decided that this was an Upset situation. We were doing the procedures but nobody called it. We unintentionally violated SPD and ALT having gotten to about 320 KIAS and 1000 ft. above level off (4000 ft. vs 3000 ft.). It took all of my skills at that moment just to get it there. There were no EICAS; Warnings or Cautions; Stick Shakers. Only a FLAP LIMIT FMA. It was ugly; quick; and violent. I felt we discussed every possibility up to that moment. In retrospect; the only thing we could have done differently was call UPSET. Not sure it would have made a lot of difference; but the AT would have been more of a priority in the recovery. We did disconnect them early in the event; but re-engaged them too early in the recovery. They fought us until we were at 4000 ft. Should have kept them off at first decision point. My scan was minimal so I don't have comments about much; only what I was focusing on; included here. Called [authorities] and Chief Pilot after landing to debrief. Chief Pilot said they thought it went well considering the events and gave us a 'Good Job' report.
Aircraft,After climbing through around 10;000 feet a rattling sound was heard and we believed it was coming from around the standby compass area. The sound got louder the higher we climb to the point of sounding like coins shaking in a can. Then around 16;000 feet a sound of something flapping against the top of the windshield was heard. A discussion between us as to where or what we thought the sound was coming from ensued. We asked ATC if we could level off at FL180 and slow to 250 knots. ZZZ Center asked if we need assistants which we stated no that we were running checklist and would get back to them. As we slowed the sound got quieter and the aircraft was maintaining pressurization.The Captain windshield had small signs of delamination when we got the aircraft in ZZZ on the previous leg. It now had moved further into the windshield and cracks were forming along the inside right edge. Pictures can be provided. This flight was an LCP (Line Check Pilot) IOE training flight. The LCP was the flying pilot and in the right seat. He called for the QRH Impaired or cracked windshield checklist. Which we complied with. After we decided to contact company via Commercial Radio and the Dispatcher got Maintenance on and they decided that we should return to ZZZ1. I asked if we need an amendment to the release and dispatch said no.  We then asked ATC for a turn back to ZZZ1. We contacted the FA and told her what was wrong and that we would be returning to ZZZ1; and that no emergency was taking place that it was just precautionary return so that maintenance could look at aircraft. During the conversation the FA inter phone started acting up and we had a hard time hearing each other before hanging up from each other.  I then made a cabin announcement with the same information.We were asked if we wanted to [request priority handling] which we again stated no not at this time.We then figured out our landing weight and fuel burn to not make an overweight landing. We then asked for holding at the IAF ZZZZZ on the ILS 16- and 10-mile legs. We completed multiple turns in the hold with the gear down and flaps 22 to increase fuel burn and then executed the visual to 16 backed up with the ILS.  While in the hold we tried to contact dispatch via ACARS but ACARS froze up.To make sure that ZZZ1 Ops new that we were returning we asked the ATC to let them know.Once on the ground deplaned and contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control and completed write up of aircraft. Seal on First Officer (FO) windshield was coming out. While we were waiting for ground personnel to marshal us in ATC asked us to write down a number for Center that they had a few questions. After; contacting maintenance; and deplaning; Captain Name called them; and they wanted to make this an incident and forward it FSDO.  I did not hear this conversation; but he stated to me he told them they would have to call the company for that kind of information.The contract maintenance that was working on the aircraft was very difficult to work with and talk to.  When I asked any questions one of them; I was told he was a supervisor; didn't like to explain what they were doing to the aircraft and got very condensing. I was then very surprised to learn that one thought I was trying to tell him how to do his job. I should have written up both windshields the FO seal and Captain delamination as separate write ups.
Human Factors,We were operating Aircraft X ZZZ to ZZZ1. Our aircraft along with several others were basically grounded waiting for the freezing rain/ ice pellets to change over to snow. There was a short window of time between the freezing rain and heavy snow that was approaching the airport; that aircraft could get de-iced and meet the holdover times. Our flight along with about 8 others; taxied out to the de-ice pad. Once a spot opened; we were assigned lane 1 for de-ice. Aircraft was configured; and de-icing was initiated. Iceman came over the frequency and said: 'Aircraft X de-icing complete; type of fluid used and the time. You are clear to depart the area; contact ground for taxi.'We re-configured cleared left and right and received taxi instructions from ground. Brought the power up to taxi and moved about 20 feet when Iceman frantically yelling over the frequency for [our aircraft but with incorrect flight number] to stop. 'Aircraft X STOP; STOP; Aircraft X STOP'. Now remember we [had a very similar flight number]. I immediately slammed on the brakes knowing we were the only aircraft that was probably heading out of the pad. I looked back to the left side as far as I could see and there was the boom truck between the wing and horizontal tail area with the boom and bucket still extended. The look of the Boom Operator said it all. I asked Iceman what is going on; he replied that he gave the wrong flight number and they are still spraying our aircraft. I verified with him our tail number just to make sure we were on the same page. Again he apologized profusely about the mix up.Obviously this was a serious situation that could of ended up with someone being seriously injured or worse. My opinion from all of this was a combination of oversaturation of aircraft to get the planes out before conditions got worse; non standard use of tail number vs flight number; and confusion as to what flight belonged to which aircraft. De-ICE crew over saturated in work; pressed to get many aircraft de-iced before the heavy snow came; confusion in regards to flight numbers and tail numbers. Review De -ice procedures; discuss how this could be averted in the future; discuss if there needs to be operating changes in how we de-ice at particular stations.
Aircraft,The slats never fully retracted; stuck between 1 and up. An ECAM was triggered and completed by recycling the flap lever. The slats still never fully retracted and we returned to ZZZ for a normal landing. Ice had built up under the slats during the nights snow storm or from the inbound flight the night prior. The de-ice prior to takeoff didn't clear the ice. No suggestions based on not knowing the whole story of why the flaps were at 1 when we showed up.
Human Factors,During our approach into ZZZ; we where given the RNAV GPS XX; using high LPV minimums. During the brief we added in a 2 mile fix around the FAF to give us visual awareness for the 'GPS APPROACH' callout. Our initial ATIS information we received called for 10 miles of visibility; high winds and a ceiling of 6500 ft. As we descended through the STAR and vectors to the GPS approach; weather was rapidly deteriorating. On final approach we descended down to 1700 ft. and the next altitude was of 800 ft. was set. Once approaching the 2 mile point the GPS approach was called and I started a vertical descent of 700 fpm mistaking it for the 0.2NM descent. With Windshear and poor visibility; I was focused on maintain proper airspeed to ensure no over speed occurred. The Captain was making sure we had forward visibility and when he glanced back into the cockpit he noticed we were below the snowflake. At the time we were approaching 1100 ft. and ATC made an altitude alert call. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and rejoined the snowflake and continued down on a 700 fpm descent following the guidance.No contact of the runway environment was made and a go-around was initiated. On the go-around ATC noted that multiple aircraft have gone around at this point. During this time a new ATIS had come out with a visibility of 1 1/2SM. We didn't realize this until after making it on the ground. ATC was giving weather updates stating that improving visibility was from the viewpoint of the Tower but no actual visibility was stated as well as ceiling updates. We went around and made a second attempt using the GPS XX approach and made contact with the runway environment and landed. With the favorable weather conditions upon the original ATIS information; we had an expectation bias that the weather was going to be good upon landing. Poor visibility due to dropping weather conditions and high winds caused a high workload environment. We set up a 2 mile fix around the FAF; ZZZZZ; to remind us to call out 'GPS APPROACH' callout. I mistakenly mistook the 2 mile distance from the FAF for the 0.2 mile distance to initiate the descent. With both the CA (Captain) and I in a high workload situation in poor weather conditions; the callout for 'VS' was unchecked even though the confirmation of 'VS' was made. The distraction wind shear and monitoring the airspeed caused me to not fully check the distance correctly from the FAF. This brought the aircraft to descend too early and caused the low altitude callout from ATC. Another error of the cause was a lack of experience on my part; this was my second GPS approach in a real aircraft in weather conditions. A go-around should have been made instead of continuing the approach even though forward visibility was there when we received the Low Altitude Alert. Had we known the visibility an approach into ZZZ1 would have been more reasonable. Even though the checklist for the GPS approach was briefed; it probably would have been good to go over it again once closer to the airport to ensure all callouts and actions are properly made. An ILS approach would have given us more visual awareness and a reduced workload. Checking the automatic ATIS update prior to making the second attempt. Another suggestion would be to review familiarize myself with GPS approaches more so since I have only done two at this point.
Ambiguous,I am happy to provide great detail for a fatigue call I felt cornered to make even though yes; I was extremely tired; I also should not have been considered legal to fly. Prior to this trip I received normal rest and felt well fit to perform my duties. Date was the start of my trip beginning with a 5 leg day and after our first flight to ZZZ; we were stuck on the ground for 3:XX hours due to a large cell that grid locked State from ZZZ1 down. I alerted Dispatch; ATC; and Crew Scheduling of this situation and suggested that scheduling assign our ZZZ2 turn to a reserve crew to keep all flights on time and avoid a rolling delay and the possibility of our crew timing out; but this was ignored and so all flights aside from our first flight were a rolling delay. After additional delays due to weather and maintenance; our crew was then required to take a 2 hour extension; leading to 7:XX of blocked flight time; 13:XX hours of duty and 12:XX hour layover. The day of my fatigue call began with rolling delays without even enough time in between to stop and eat.Our crew did our best to make up flight time and turn time to get the delays minimized; however due to a heavy snowstorm in ZZZ3; we had to wait in line to be de-iced. We ended up over blocking over 1:XX hours on our flight back to ZZZ4. If scheduling would have built out the trips correctly showing a 40 minute turn in ZZZ4 and a 3 hour blocked flight to ZZZ5; it would have showed us going beyond our 13 hour FDP (Flight Duty Period) for Date 1. The trip had been manipulated to show a 3X minute turn and 10 minutes less of block which with 15 minutes of post duty time; we would have been still past 13 hours of block. Since I had been extended the night prior; I then need 30 hours of rest before being extended again. When contacting the scheduler about this I was told that the situation was being monitored and that updated number were 'in the cue'. I was told to hold off until receiving a push notification and a call from scheduling. At this point I was definitely fatigued and was going to generate a report regardless; however I did not want to have to use the fatigue call and deal with the negative ramifications of doing so (i.e.; sick bank reduction and reduction of min guarantee/tier pay) considering that this was a legal issue as well.After receiving the updated data that clearly showed that pushing back 5 minutes prior to receiving the 'updated' numbers that we were going to arrive at ZZZ5 beyond our FDP; I then called scheduling again to be released legally. We ended up conferencing Chief Pilot to discuss legality.  I was told that if I push right now; 10 minute taxi to take off and 2:XX of flight and 5 minutes taxi into ZZZ5 that I'd be able to make it with the 30 minute extension. All of that was predicated on being fully boarded and pushing back at that moment (XA:45pm) and taking off no later than XB:05pm with only 2:XX flight time which we were not at all in the position to do. The math was completely skewed as we hadn't boarded because we were told to hold off since we were very close to illegally crossing into our hard 117 limitation.  One minute beyond would result in a violation of 117 rest requirements and is completely illegal. The Chief Pilot was asked how to proceed by the scheduler and stated that if scheduling said we are able to make it happen based on their timeline then we should try for it. I expressed the unrealistic ability to make the flight happen and the situation of violating a 117 regulation and still was made out to feel that I was the cause of our delay. If anything happened in flight as in ATC slowing us down; giving us a hold; deviating around weather (which we very well may have needed to do) or simply not had a ground crew ready to taxi us in; I would have been in the situation of needing to divert; open the flight deck door prior to block in or declare an emergency to get to an airport in time before violating my 117 rest requirements. I knew my personal limits as to my own health and well-being and was certainly tired regardless; therefore was forced to use the fatigue call even though using realistic numbers; we were not legal to fly but was; in my opinion; being bullied into trying to make the flight happen at all cost and that to me is a big safety concern.I believe that crew scheduling needs to not pressure pilots into potentially violating 117 regulations. It is a joint responsibility of our team to ensure that the flight is safe and legal to fly. They also need to do a better job of collaborating with the pilot group. This entire situation could have been avoided had scheduling removed the ZZZ2 turn from our crew the night before as I had suggested. All flights aside from ZZZ-ZZZ4 would have been operated on time. Instead this lead to out crew worked to the extent of our legal limits during fatiguing situations such as weather; maintenance and delays. I understand that we are in a tight situation with Pilot availability; however it is most important that flights are being conducted safely and in correspondence with 117 FDP limitations.I believe the root cause might be the culture that we are in currently. We have a very short staff of reserve pilots at the moment and so I feel that mostly we try to stretch our pilots thin in order to satisfy the consumer demands of travel. I would have loved to see that flight go and get the customers to their destination; however it is my responsibility to operate that aircraft safely and legally. It should not be the culture to pressure pilots into making a flight happen that will potentially cause a violation. This culture is a safety concern and must be changed.
Aircraft,Cabin crew smelled an odd odor in the cabin during initial climb and noticed worsening of odor as we continued climb. Crew member informed the Captain regarding smell and Captain decided to divert to ZZZ. Fire department and paramedics met the flight and assessed passengers; crew and cabin. Crew members had mild headaches and dizziness and all decided to go to the ER for further assessment and blood draw for carbon monoxide poisoning. All flights and cabin crew were discharged with notes to observe got any worsening our presence of symptoms.
Aircraft,When I arrived at the airport in ZZZ; I noticed that the door flap for the 1L door was protruding out quite a bit. I disarmed the one L door at the gate; and quickly did a test of my flat hand in to grab the white main handle and slightly pulled back and noticed that my hand had pinched between the main handle and the cover flap. This has been an ongoing problem and I have been told to continue reporting this. I informed the Captain and he and every crew member on board tested and had the same issue of their hands being pinched as well. Maintenance was called and arrived which resulted in a lengthy delay and which eventually I saw the entire door covering removed. We were advised that another aircraft had arrived and we would be switching gates; so when we arrived to the second aircraft the same issue applied with that lining cover for the 1L door as well. We informed maintenance and the Maintenance Staff as well had the same issue of their hands being pinched. In this case; because there was no prior damage to the molding of the door; they were able to adjust the bracket so that the lining cover sprung into place with enough allowable room for everyone to operate the main handle door properly. Every door in our entire fleet should be tested; and certified before sending into service. It is not a preflight for the Flight Attendants at this time to check that main handle door. However; it is obvious that it is a failure. I don't know why this isn't done across our fleet as serious bodily injury would result for anyone operating that door in emergency mode.
Aircraft,I detected a slight chemical odor while taxiing out. Upon lift off and climb the chemical odor became very strong. All crew members; 1 through 4 plus Captain and First Officer noticed the same smell. The Captain continued to communicate with us and the decision was made to return to ZZZ.
Aircraft,DATE Flight from ZZZ1-ZZZZ. After departing ZZZ1 during our climb to altitude we received numerous A/I WING HOT R Crew Alert System messages. We ran the check list for above Crew Alert System message performing action described. After Crew Alert System message reoccurred with all anti ice off and reducing power on the right engine the crew decided to [request priority handling.] After discussing the situation with operations the decision was made to change our destination to ZZZ2 because that was the closest suitable airport with VFR conditions not requiring a descent through icing condition. Eventually the Crew Alert System message went out and stayed out. The flight proceed without further incident.
Ambiguous,On visual approach to Runway 31R in DAL. Autopilot engaged; captured on localizer and glide slope; on five-mile final.  Aircraft holding short was told to line up and wait on runway. As that aircraft taxied into position; our glide slope indication deviated almost one dot; and the aircraft pitched down. We received an EGPWS; 'Caution Obstacle Alert.' The Pilot Flying disconnected the autopilot and corrected the deviation. We landed without incident. We believe the aircraft on the runway corrupted the glide slope signal and caused the aircraft pitch over and subsequent EGPWS caution. [To prevent this; there should be] better ILS signal that can overcome aircraft interference whilst taxiing onto runway; and possible Tower policy to have aircraft hold short while over downtown.
Aircraft,En route ZZZ1 to ZZZ2; First Officer's leg at FL340 we had an un commanded rapid climb to FL350 at approximately (time). We got the aircraft under control and noticed the First Officers altimeter fluctuating wildly. We transferred controls to my side and notified ATC of the altitude deviation and started working the problem. We referenced the Quick Reference Handbook for FMC scratch pad messages IRS-R Drift and Verify POS: IRS-IRS. While working on those issues with the autopilot on the A side; all of the First Officer's PFD instruments displayed all flags with an IRS FAULT. We ran the Quick Reference Handbook for IRS FAULT; but could not fix it and continued flight to ZZZ2 with no autopilot/auto throttle. Being busy hand-flying and trying to manage the navigation problem we unintentionally neglected to notify Dispatch of our problem. We had already coordinated our arrival with ZZZ2 Operations and asked to have Maintenance meet the aircraft. Maintenance met us at the gate and I wrote up the IRS FAULT in the logbook. We then handed the aircraft over to Maintenance in ZZZ2.
Human Factors,Aircraft moved while Ground Crew was still at nose of aircraft. Aircraft made contact with tug and glass window broke on driver. Driver screamed set parking brake; and again screamed set parking brake. I looked down at parking brake and it was off so I reached down to set it immediately. Then Ground Staff asked us to shut down engines. Ground staff was quite shaken up and got out of the tug. Eventually tug was removed and aircraft was tugged back to gate.Ground Crew was yelling to set parking brake and I noticed we were moving as well.I remember when Ground Staff asked Captain to set parking brake; I saw the Captain look out the window and make sure we were not moving; and his arm went out and down to set parking brake; yet I did not see him actually set the parking brake. After engine 2 started we both started our flow. I started with speed brake armed; and went to FMS for CG percentage to set. I went and set the trim to around 28%; which was UP0.8; and put it into the FMS. That is about the time Ground Staff was screaming at us to set the parking brake. I looked at Captain and looked down at the parking brake and it was off; so I immediately set the parking brake for the Captain and we came to a sudden stop. I didn't even notice we were moving until we were told to set parking brake. And I don't know if Captain set the parking brake or not before and then released it somehow. I looked up at Captain since I thought parking brake was set; so I looked down at the parking brake and it was off; so I reached down to set the brake to on.First Officer I'm not sure of what exactly happened if the Captain set the parking brake the first time they asked him to; but I know it was off later. I flew this type aircraft before for 7 years; and the after start flow at this Company is slightly different. I was told here to tell the Ground Staff to disconnect first before starting the PF (Pilot Flying) flow with the start/ignition switch. (My old Company it was after the PF set the start/ignition selector to normal; then tell Ground Crew disconnect and next start PF flow). However it's quite possible that the Captain after telling Ground Crew; when he went to move the start/ignition back to normal he inadvertently took off the parking brake as well. I personally like to set the start/ignition switch back to normal first before discounting. The parking brake and start/ignition switch are relatively close and have a same rotation of right and left. Other suggestion; is to always double verify before we move switches. Two step actions is hand to the switch; look at the switch to verify; then move the switch after verified.
Aircraft,We had flown this plane for the two previous legs of the day without any problems. Upon pushing back from the gate and taxiing to the runway; all checklists were properly completed and the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System was noted without any discrepancies showing. We were cleared for takeoff; and during the climb we got a status message for right oil level low. This isn't a unique occurrence; but when we checked the level it read 15%. Throughout the day both levels had been above 80% for the previous legs; so this was concerning. We initially thought it was a reading error; until we also saw the right oil pressure gauge drop until it was amber. We immediately notified ATC that we needed to level off and return to the field. The Captain held off on requesting landing priority to ATC and they leveled us off at 16;000 feet and then began vectoring us and descending us to come back to the airfield.I continued to fly the aircraft while the Captain began running checklists and getting the airplane set up to return to the field. I noted how heavy we were when we were running the numbers and the Captain also took note of it. Once all checklists were complete and the flight deck was set up for the approach; the weight had come down but we were still going to be slightly above max landing weight. I asked the Captain if we should continue to get vectors and burn the extra fuel or if we should land. The Captain made the Pilot in Command decision to land the aircraft slightly overweight as he didn't want to risk the oil pressure dropping further and potentially losing an engine; because that would cause even more issues and could potentially risk the safety of the passengers. We were cleared for the approach and landed without incident smoothly at 75400 lbs.; roughly 300 lbs. overweight since the aircraft was a CRJ-900. Once we had taxied off the runway; the right oil pressure warning message came on and the Captain shut down the engine. We taxied and parked at the gate without further incident and maintenance met us at the gate. We notified maintenance; dispatch; and the occurrence report of the overweight landing accordingly. In this situation; although we hadn't [requested priority landing]; it could have easily progressed to that point. So the options we faced were to either land slightly overweight but get the plane on the ground as soon as safely possible; or don't land overweight; continue to get vectors until we burn the fuel; but risk the oil pressure dropping to an [priority] situation; losing an engine; and risking the safety of the passengers. Both situations have their pros and cons; but thinking of passenger safety; and how close we were to landing at the correct weight; the Captain chose the Pilot in Command decision to return to the field and land slightly overweight.
Procedure,We were on the ramp in ZZZ at approximately XA35z. (Engines not running). The First Officer and I just completed the supplementary procedure with respect to Deicing. We coordinated with the Deicing personnel via frequency XXX.XX. The deicing personnel was instructed by me to spray the aircraft with Type I and Type IV fluid full body. After the aircraft was sprayed the deicing personnel notified us with the time; application of fluid; brand and mixture. I called for the completion of the supplementary procedure. Approximately one minute after a fire warning appeared with a main deck cargo fire. I instructed the First Officer to take out the Cargo Fire (Main) Quick Reference Checklist (QRC) and shortly thereafter I also instructed the First Officer that an evacuation will be necessary momentarily. Time was of the essence and I said let's open the flight deck door to get moving; we saw smoke entering the cockpit. The First officer immediately closed the flight deck door. I instructed the First Officer that we will evacuate immediately through the flight deck window. The First officer opened his window and in the interest of saving time; I reached for First Officer's escape rope so that we could evacuate quicker. The First Officer exited first and when I saw he made it safely on the ground I subsequently went after. Prior to leaving; I turned the APU off. I made it safely to the ground. The Fire trucks arrived on the scene shortly thereafter. Deicing Fluid sprayed in the APU inlet door. This triggered the main deck cargo fire. Have more oversight on the outsourced vendors and perhaps have a Company employed personnel physically present to monitor the procedures that are compliant with Company. Retrain the Deicing vendors.
Aircraft,I called for flaps 1 then 5 then 10. FO (First Officer) noticed a flap asymmetry just prior to flaps at 5. Handle was already at 10. Flaps did not move from 5 to 10. I executed a go-around with Approach and requested priority handling. I briefed the FA's (Flight Attendants) and the passengers. We flew a box pattern as I accomplished the QRH procedure for alternate flap extension. Flaps were moved to 15. QRH was finished and we flew the ILS visual to Runway XX Left. Landing was uneventful and rollout was normal. Rescue trucks looked over the aircraft and followed me to the gate.
Aircraft,Our flight was due to depart at XA:00; ZZZ-ZZZ1; and was filed to fly the entire route within and just east of an advancing frontal system that stretched the entire length of the east coast. Conditions for our departure were IFR with light precipitation. We departed XXL with a tailwind; Takeoff Go Around; APU ON; ANTI-ICE ON; CONFIG 2; and immediately found ourselves in widespread light to moderate precipitation; light to moderate chop; and a need to begin deviations for weather as we proceeded on course. We cleaned the aircraft up; including turning off the APU bleed and APU as normal. While climbing through 10000 ft.; I noticed an unusual odor that was gradually increasing in strength. I asked my Captain if he detected it also; and he said yes. Before reaching FL180; the #1 Flight Attendant called the cockpit and stated that he smelled an unusual 'oily; burnt hydraulic fluid' smell. I concurred and thought that was an apt description. My Captain asked him to try to determine if it seemed to be getting stronger; dissipating; or staying the same; and if it were possible to see where it may be coming from. After reaching FL250; or just a few minutes later; several of the Flight Attendants called back at the same time and informed my Captain that they found the smell to be at least as strong; if not more so than previously reported. I explained to him that I had a good understanding and awareness of Smoke/Odor/Fumes events; and it was my opinion that we were experiencing one. He then asked me for my input about how we should proceed. I said that I felt it would be wise to [put on] our oxygen masks; land without delay at the nearest suitable airport and run the Smoke/Odor/Fumes and Overweight Landing checklists on the way to that airport. He agreed and informed the Cabin Crew of our intentions while I took the radios in addition to flying duties and [requested priority handling] an immediate return to ZZZ. While making our return to ZZZ; the widespread precipitation conditions we were in were such that our weather radar displayed mostly green returns; with occasional yellow interspersed within which would normally indicate light rain; but the very loud rain noise made it obvious that we were in at least very heavy precipitation. This phenomenon was making the radar of not very much use other than to confirm that there was rain in front of us. Constant light to moderate chop persisted through the entire event; also. Another trait of the Airbus 320 family is that the VHF radios produce a great deal of loud static when flying through precipitation for extended periods; and particularly in the vicinity of charged clouds; which in this case made ATC difficult if not impossible to understand at times; and added to the now very loud environment of the cockpit. Despite these challenges; we were able to comply with ATC's directions and make a nearly direct path back to the ILS for Runway XXL (which by now was no longer experiencing a tailwind for landing). My Captain recognized that we would be back on the ground soon enough that he had to prioritize which QRH checklist to execute; the Smoke/Odor/Fumes checklist; or the Overweight Landing Checklist. We chose to perform the Overweight Landing checklist first and found that when we turned the APU and APU BLEED on as the procedure directs; the odor began to abate. We were satisfied that this configuration of the air conditioning system was now the optimal one and decided to continue to land without further reference to the Smoke/Odor/Fumes checklist; as time before landing was now quite short. I made a relatively soft landing; approximately 12000 lbs. overweight without any other irregularities; and we taxied the aircraft to the gate normally. There were no excessive brake temperatures. By this time; we could scarcely detect the odor anymore; and I felt comfortable to have my oxygen mask off for the duration of the taxi. It may be that we had begun to acclimate to the smell; because when we parked at the gate and opened the main cabin door; the Mechanics who immediately boarded the airplane stated that they noticed the telltale smell right away. Appropriate Maintenance logbook entries were made; a Smoke/Odor/Fumes form was completed; and much discussion with the Mechanics took place about what we experienced.As of yet; I haven't heard any confirmation of what caused the event in this airplane. I could only speculate that oil or hydraulic fluid found its way into the bleed system of one or both engines and was transmitted as a fine vapor through the packs and into the cabin. It seems that the APU may not be a likely culprit in this case as the smell wasn't noticed by us during taxi-out; take-off; or during our overweight landing. The APU BLEED was supplying air to the packs in all three of these instances.I think that this is an area where it would be best to solicit suggestions from Maintenance Personnel and the manufacturer. I have what I would judge as a heightened awareness of these events (especially now); but not a complete understanding of the specific Mechanics of these events as it pertains to the engine/APU bearings; oil systems; etc. The industry; company; and pilot unions seems to have taken significant steps in recent years to address these events and raise awareness; but my suggestion would be to pursue these steps further. I have flown with many pilots who have limited knowledge of the prevalence and risks associated with Smoke/Odor/Fume events; which is surprising considering that (based on my limited perspective and data) these events seem to rank high among drivers of QRH usage and diversions; etc. I think including information about them in distance learning modules would be a good idea.
Aircraft,Aircraft X ZZZ - ZZZ1. Enroute. ECAM Message appeared. AIR - ENG BLD 2 ABNORM PR. Executed ECAM procedure and follow up. Reset unsuccessful. Coordinated with Dispatch for diversion into ZZZ2 due to weather conditions at ZZZ1. Landed ZZZ2 without incident. [Priority handling requested] by Captain. This caused some confusion amongst the changing ATC facilities. Went ahead and [requested priority handling] for brevity sake.
Ambiguous,Encountered wake turbulence on the RYDRR2 arrival LAX from a B777. Took evasive actions routing and descent path.  I could not stabilize our approach to 24R due to residual wake and made a go around/missed approach. Returned for approach 25L and made a normal approach and landing. Red eye flight. In a very stable air mass. Wake turbulence was severe enough to change headings and descent paths for avoiding injury and aircraft damage.
Human Factors,During the preflight of the nose gear; I missed the nose gear being installed. No 'remove before flight' flag was visible. Upon inspection of the pin stowage rack it was noted that the nose gear pin was missing. The CA (Captain) asked the ramp crew to see if it was still installed; but they were unable to ascertain whether the pin was installed. The CA conducted a visual inspection and was also unable to determine if the pin was installed. The aircraft took off with the nose gear pin installed with the FO (First Officer) as Pilot Flying. During the gear retraction; a 'gear disagree' warning was received and we began coordinating a level-off with ATC. I became distracted with the gear annunciator during the level-off and allowed the aircraft to over speed the nose gear which was in the down position. Once level; we coordinated with ATC to complete the emergency action items; configure the aircraft; complete all checklists; and return for a safe landing.I was not as familiar with the 700 preflight as I should be. The lack of an attached flag could have contributed to my missing the pin being installed. I have had other crew members tell me that they have seen maintenance borrow flags for other aircraft. This probably allowed me to believe that the pin was never installed. I will never miss a pin again; flag or no flag.
Aircraft,We operated Aircraft X from ZZZ to ZZZ1. Departing Runway XX; shortly after rotation we had a DOOR AFT CARGO ECAM caution. I requested with ATC to level off at 5;000 ft. to trouble shoot the condition. After performing ECAM actions; the indication did not go away. We noticed a low cabin pressure but it was due to the low altitude as well. The First Officer (FO) checked information for our situation. At that point we could not determine if the cabin would hold pressure or if the cargo door would remain closed. Considering the flight was a trans con of 5:40 min; I decided the safest course of action was to divert to ZZZ2. I requested priority handling and proceeded to ZZZ2. The FO performed an Over weight Landing Checklist on the QRH as well as landing Data for Runway XXC. I landed the aircraft as smoothly as possible due to the heavy weight (195K Lbs.) No over weight landing faults were recorded or over heated brakes conditions were noted. After clearing the Runway; the emergency ground personnel inspected the door and found no damage. At that time proceeded to the gate and maintenance was notified. Maintenance in ZZZ2 never opened the cargo door to inspect locks or sensors.
MEL,We [were] operating flight Aircraft X ZZZ-ZZZ1. After door closure but before push back we get an ACARS message to contact Maintenance Control.I called on my phone and talked with Name; he informed me that there might be a problem with our aircraft maintenance logbook and an inspection that might be due. My first call was at XA:08 local time. Name informed me to hold the flight at the gate while they [were] researching the timing of the write up on log page XXXXXXX; of Aircraft X; there was supposed to be an inspection of a fan blade made within a certain time frame.We had the jet way pulled back to the aircraft and open the main cabin door. I informed passengers of the situation and that we [were] waiting on further information from our Maintenance Control in ZZZ. We communicated our situation with the Station Operations and Dispatch.At XA:48 local time I called Maintenance Control again; at this time I was informed that the aircraft was grounded because an inspection was due.I informed our passengers of the situation and asked them to deplane. The flight had been canceled.If the aircraft maintenance logbook had a block to where the time of the write up could be logged we as pilots could help track the timing of required instructions. The current logbook is of no use to pilots. If we know when a write up was done we could refer to our MEL/CDL (Configuration Deviation List) and see when an inspection or a resolution would need to be done.
Aircraft,We had a hyd 1 lo qty advisory message about half enroute from original flight plan of ZZZ-ZZZ1. We ran our QRH checklist and kept an eye on it. We talked to our maintenance in case we got a failure on it. They advised us besides running the checklist there wasn't going to be anything else to help the hydraulic levels in flight. Later on in flight we got rerouted to fly to ZZZ2 VOR then to ZZZZZ for ZZZ1 arrival. Once in that direction and south of lake ZZZ3 is when hyd 1 failed. We ran our checklist and chose to make a request for priority handling to ATC and chose ZZZ2 since it was relatively close; long Runway available and equipment available if necessary. We advised our passengers what was happening. We continued into ZZZ2 and landed Runway XX got off the Runway successfully and then proceeded to wait awhile for a tug since we lost our steering. Hydraulic leak and/or pump failure. More thorough maintenance check since hyd 2 had issues few days prior.
Aircraft,Hyd 2 low qty message in flight; hyd quantity indicator continued to drop until reaching zero. Diverted to ZZZ.
Human Factors,While training on sectors ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ Aircraft X checked on to the frequency from the NW descending from 10;000 ft. to 7;000 ft. On initial contact they were given the altimeter and a descent to 6;000 ft. Once clear of other traffic inbound to ZZZ I gave them a turn to the NE and descended down to 4;700 feet which is the MVA in that area. I heard him read back to maintain 4;700 feet. My trainer and I noticed that he was descending below the MVA and issued the minimum vectoring altitude phraseology. He then climbed back up to 4;700 feet. After listening to the tapes; he read back to descend to 4;000 feet but said it in a manner where it sounded like the correct altitude to descend to.Controller Recommendation:Listen carefully to pilot read backs
Human Factors,On final approach to [Runway] 28R; having been cleared for the visual approach and established on the localizer and glideslope; at approximately 1400 ft. AGL we received a 'Descend' RA. We complied with the RA until it ceased; and; almost simultaneously we received a Low Altitude Alert from SFO Tower. We responded that we were complying with a TCAS RA and that we were visual.  We then continued the approach and landed uneventfully.
Ambiguous,FAR 117 and Company policies are inadequate to ensure proper rest opportunities. A 10-hour minimum rest; allowing 30 minutes for round trip transportation and 8 hours of sleep opportunity; a mere 90 minutes of rest remains to check in to the hotel; eat; exercise; prepare for sleep; allow for hygiene; and prepare for the new work day. Often; set hotel transportation schedules further eat into the 90 minutes of 'personal time.' Ninety minutes is insufficient after a sometimes 16+ hour day to achieve adequate rest. Furthermore; Company's reliance on early morning departures often requires attempting to sleep as early as 6 PM body clock time to attempt 8 hours of sleep. Proper hygiene; exercise; nutrition; and rest are important for personal health; even more so during a pandemic.Company relies solely on legal minimums; without opportunity to mitigate fatigue. A Pilot's only option is to declare fatigue and return to rest. A fatigue call should be an anomaly; used when unusual events occur; not the only mechanism in place for a Pilot abused by Company Scheduling practices; to ensure safe operations of flight. Contractual compliance is more of a guideline for Company. They seem to be reactionary; rather than proactively complying with the fatigue mitigation requirements limiting duty day.Flight duty app does a poor job of ensuring legal and contractual compliance. It seems as though there is a 'set it and forget it' approach. Once assigned; it is the Pilot's responsibility to ensure compliance; rather than it being a shared responsibility. Flight duty app's continued rerouting of Crews; affected by other operational difficulties; subjects additional Crews to long days; short nights while creating further operational challenges of displaced Crews.Company provides fatigue mitigation training through distance learning modules. There is no opportunity to implement mitigation strategies when Company Scheduling response to questioning the efficiency or efficacy of a reassignment is; 'But it's legal.' Company needs to do better than reaching for the bare minimum when it comes to something as paramount to Flight Safety; as Crew Member fatigue.FAR 117 needs to be improved to adequately address fatigue concerns. Both [military branch X] and [military branch Y] require 12 hours of off-duty time to allow for transportation; nutrition; exercise; hygiene; and rest. Ten hours is insufficient to allow for each of these necessary part of healthy human existence. Company needs to treat its Crew Members as people; not machines. Repetitive long days and short nights increases risk. A Pilot overestimating his/her condition and ability increases risk. Mitigation strategies need to be emphasized rather than relying on a fatigue call as the only mechanism to repair Company's inefficient scheduling practices
Human Factors,I was in the Jumpseat for a Captains FAA Observation.Up until the descent; the observation was going well. With ZZZ landing East; the crew decided to brief for a RNAV (RNP) Y to Runway XXL. Descending through FL190 or so there was some CBs that had built up; no Flight Attendant notification of possible turbulence. There was some moderate turbulence associated with the CBs; I suspect this was the start of loss of some SA.The crew had been given direct ZZZZZ on the ZZZZZ1 and a descend via clearance; 6000 ft. was set in the MCP. New Captain trying to get the plane to start a descent (system I believe was still calculating the direct ZZZZZ and had not started down yet) pushed the Alt INTV which deleted the ZZZZZ's altitude restriction of 12000 to 9000 ft.; retaining the speed of 250 kts. He did verbalize this but did not reiterate that the restriction was 12000 to 9000 ft.; the LCA (Line Check Airman) only retyped in 12000. This started the high on Path situation. The plane achieved 12000 ft. some 5 miles prior to ZZZZZ. The SPD INTV was selected to 280 kts. 280 kts. is what they crossed ZZZZZ at; I verbalized to the right seater (the LCA in the right seat); 'check your speed; should be 250 kts'.  New Captain used VS; then selected 250 kts. in the MCP but still was not descending for the next restriction ZZZZZ1 at 210/6000.VS was this Captain's go to mode; he tried several times to select VS but was pushing the round white 'light sensor' on the MCP; located above and right of the VS select button. Started down in VS (at this time some 2300 ft. above the Path); speed now 250 kts. I verbalized the restriction. The LCA received relief from ZZZZZ1's altitude of 6000 ft.; speed of 210 kts. was not mentioned. ATC stated; cross ZZZZZ2 at 3000 ft. cleared for the RNV Z XXL. The crew was also dealing with the fact that they had originally requested RNAV (RNP) Y; this is what they briefed. Approach stated later they could not issue the Y but could for the Z; the crew was working on a this approach change briefing in the middle of the altitude restriction issue adding to further loss is SA. With 3000 ft. in the MCP; VNAV would not reengage initially so VS was still in use. LCA stated to use LVL CHG as new Captain was struggling with speed management. At this point it looked like everything was coming back under control. Once speed was lowered to an acceptable value; VNAV was selected again and TDZE was selected. I started taking some notes; glancing up to see that they were out of VNAV descending now through 3000 ft. (still prior to ZZZZZ2) I started to say something but the LCA had already started to comment. It looks as if 2800 ft. was going to be the lowest they were going to get; with correction now being applied.I suspect but can't be for sure; a new mode was selected trying to gain control of the speed or VNAV just disengaged. Flaps were first called for at 250 kts. and a comment from the LCA that he was too fast.When trying to correct the low altitude situation with (I believe) a MCP mode change; LNAV was deselected as CWS R was now displayed in the FMA. Unfortunately this happened right at ZZZZZ2 where a left turn was required.There was a great number of distractions going on; it seems that the input from the LCA was not promptly executed; paired with a lagging SA; this was leading to additional distractions. ATC had now called 'low altitude warning' as the new Captain allowed (and the LCA along with myself didn't catch) the plane to sink again now to 2500 ft. The CWS R grabbing our attention and the LCA calling for a left turn; this off course situation was also being called out by ATC.Turning off the Autopilot to regain a desirable state was achieved and the remaining approach and landing was uneventful.
Procedure,Landed Runway X in ZZZ; complied with taxi instructions [to] hold short Runway XX. Then received clearance cross Runway XX on Taxiway X contact ground. Once we crossed Taxiway X we were approaching Taxiway Y when ATC told us to slow down and stop right where we were as a B737 was approaching fast from the right on Taxiway Y. We were never told to hold short of Taxiway Y but had we not stopped there could have been an incident with the other aircraft.As the Captain and the one taxiing; I should have stopped sooner. The only reason I hadn't stopped yet at the point of ATC alerting us to the aircraft to our right was that I wanted to ensure I was clear of Runway XX. A momentary lack of situational awareness led me to not see the B737 approaching from my right.As the Captain I need to maintain the highest level of situational awareness during the entire taxi phase; specifically at taxi and runway intersections. A suggestion would be for ATC to tell us that there is an aircraft approaching from the right and we need to give way to them at Taxiway Y. Had ATC done that I would've stopped well short of the Taxiway Y intersection.
Aircraft,While climbing through apx.16K feet an EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) caution message illuminated along with the associated bell of PAC 2 OVHT. Also a status message of PAC 2 VLV CLSD illuminated. I went for the QRH but both messages disappeared within less than 20 seconds [they never reappeared throughout the rest of the flight]. The FO (First Officer) and I discussed what could have caused that and I speculated that it may have been from the Flight Attendant (FA) demanding too much of it by having too high of a heat setting. I checked to see the temp controller was set for the FA to have control and then called her over the intercom. Sure enough she said it was set to max. I asked her to set it to 75-80% because we believed it was being taxed too heavily and she said she would.About 2 min after that both the FO and I smelled smoke that had a distinctive scent of electrical wires burning. I called the FA again to see if she smelled smoke and she confirmed it (I believe she was in front at this time).I turned on my overhead light to start looking up in the QRH and it was then that I and my FO saw smoke wafting in the light. At that point I called to don the O2 masks and to execute the O2 mask donning memory items which we did and established communication. As my FO was flying I then ran the QRC checklist followed by the QRH. The QRH stated to close the gasper and recirc fans which I did. And it also stated to; if possible; remove the source of smoke. Since the smoke was associated with the appearance of the PAK 2 EICAS message and I had turned it off; I considered that it had been removed. We then [requested priority handling] and both agreed that return to ZZZ was the best option.I briefly considered diverting to another more nearby airport and looked around and at the MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) and into the FMS but ultimately decided to return to ZZZ as the smoke did not seem to be getting any worse at that point.I called my FA and gave her a brief on the situation and that we would be on the ground in 8-12 minutes and that she should wrap things up in 5-7 minutes and that we might deplane away from a gate. After this I made an announcement to the passengers that we had had a situation arise that was serious enough to require a return to ZZZ but I did not tell them what it was because I did not want to cause undue panic. About 5-7 minutes later when I had a little more time I called her back to give a formal brief.Dispatch queried us via ACARS that it appeared we were going back to ZZZ and wanted to know what was going on. I hadn't had time to call or notify them and I considered the problem serious enough to warrant a decision to return without their input. I responded to the ACARS and confirmed the return to ZZZ and the reason.We took vectors to get back and the descent and landing were uneventful with the only other consideration being overweight. Just prior to being turned onto final both my FO and I agreed it was safe to remove our O2 masks as the smoke had dissipated mostly and was not getting worse. Though we were able to communicate with them on removing them made it much easier. Just prior to the final approach fix I took the controls to do the overweight landing (overweight by approximately 308 lbs by our calculations) and carefully brought it down being sure to touch down with less than 300 FPM of vertical descent. I allowed the aircraft to float slightly to ensure a soft touchdown and took the second high speed ramp. Upon taxiing clear of the runway we ran the after landing checklist and conferred with the FA that there was no fire or smoke in the cabin and upon a negative confirmation I then confirmed over the radio with the Fire Commander on duty that there was no external fire. Deciphering there would be minimal hazard to taxiing to a safer area to deplane; my FO and I agreed it would be best to taxi to an area where airstairs could be arranged and we requested that.But Ground and the Fire Commander on duty were comfortable taking us to a gate and instructed us to taxi to the gates; which we did; with multiple fire trucks escorting us and uneventfully.Parking and shutdown were uneventful.
Company Policy,We conducted a Missed Approach on the RNAV (GPS) Runway XX Approach due to weather. We were additionally concerned about not being in compliance with 5G Restrictions as a result of not reaching visual conditions by the Final Approach Point. We were unable to fly the ILS Runway XY Approach (which most likely would have remedied the whole situation); and this was due to having STALL PROT speeds and because of the wind conditions. After executing the Missed Approach procedure; we then coordinated with ATC to attempt another RNAV Runway XX Approach. The weather deteriorated to worse conditions than before during our second approach; so we executed another Missed Approach procedure. After our second Missed Approach procedure; our fuel amount was close to our bingo fuel amount and it was necessary to divert to our Alternate Airport; which was ZZZ1. We coordinated with Dispatch and diverted to ZZZ1.After we arrived in ZZZ1 and after speaking with our Dispatcher; I spoke with a Flight Ops Duty Officer to help determine whether or not we could legally attempt a flight back to ZZZ and do so in full compliance with our Flight and Aircraft Manuals; Crew Notices; as well as NOTAMs; given the conditions along with the 5G considerations. The weather was forecast to improve at ZZZ; and we concluded that we legally would be able to return and attempt another landing at ZZZ given all aforementioned considerations. We coordinated with Dispatch and Operations and got nearly fully ready to go; but we then discovered that were over-fueled by approximately 3200 lbs of fuel. We had to remove baggage from our aircraft in order to meet our weight restrictions.We were additionally unable to use our EFB App in order to obtain our release as appropriate revisions digitally after we arrived in ZZZ1. This occurred once again after we arrived in ZZZ (I'm guessing this was likely due to the flight numbers being the same as our first flight leg); so we had to coordinate with Operations on receiving paper copies of our release and revisions; and this may have caused for some additional undue delays. After we executed our first Missed Approach procedure; we were told to fly the Published Missed Approach and got assigned 4000 ft; so we confirmed our instructions with Departure; and got assigned a Hold over ZZZZZ [Intersection]; which we quickly arrived at. I then mistakenly forgot to call our Holding Pattern Entry and Exit times to ATC; and this was likely due to being task saturated from finishing up with our Missed Approach Procedure; Checklists; trying to set up the assigned holding pattern into our FMS; while also communicating with our Flight Attendants; Passengers; and Dispatch.My FO (First Officer) and I both thought that we were familiar with the information presented in Crew Notice XX-XXX as well as 5G considerations in general. That said; we were each individually under the impression that RNAV Approaches were prohibited without an AMOC (Alternative Method of Compliance) (and that Only ILS and Visual Approaches were permissible at 5G-Affected Airports with no AMOC.) Upon further inspection of Crew Notice XX-XXX however; we found more information regarding RNAV Approaches (hidden within the RNP AR paragraph--easy for one to overlook in my opinion); essentially stating that restrictions on RNAV Approaches are NOTAM dependent. Even upon discovering that info however; we were still left questioning in the back of our minds whether or not the RNAV Approach was indeed legal given the 5G/AMOC considerations in concordance with the NOTAMs of our destination. This is ultimately what caused me to ask for the additional opinion of a Flight Ops Duty Officer; as in the moment of it all the information all seemed somewhat convoluted to both of us. We feel as though we did the right thing by making the conservative decision of not flying a legally questionable approach; however it would have been nice to have the information more clear and readily available as that may have potentially prevented any and all confusion in this situation.
Aircraft,On date as we reported to the gate we were informed that our ZZZ-ZZZ1 A320 flight Aircraft X was delayed due to maintenance. When the Tech Operations staff were finished; appropriate MELs were applied including 32-XX-XX inoperative. We complied with the MEL's required O procedures and left the gate at XA54z with 17+1 passengers. First Officer was the PF (Pilot Flying) then as per the MEL a TOGA takeoff was performed at XB10z.After reaching cruise altitude IMC southwest of ZZZ2; we received dashboard fault annunciations and LGCIU 1 fault ECAM. Non-normal SOP's were followed; the FO continued as PF and ECAM steps were performed followed by associated QRH procedures. Multiple systems were inoperative including normal gear extension; nosewheel steering; auto pilot; auto thrust; flight directors and wing anti-ice (operative for 30 seconds after selection). We decided; based on the current winter weather at our destination ZZZ1 along with reported icing conditions; to return to ZZZ. There was a large low weather system advancing northeasterly. ZZZ1 weather was 1SM -SN and OVC004. ZZZ weather was 10SM and BKN055.We requested a diversion back to ZZZ from ATC. ACARS message was sent to Dispatch. Captain communicated with the flight attendants and passengers. During the descent; the Captain took over PF duties. The First Officer reviewed the QRH and inoperative systems. Radar vectors were requested to the current runway in use; [Runway] XXR. After we both had reviewed the inoperative systems we discussed the manual gear extension steps and whether or not to declare an emergency. About this time ZZZ contacted us and informed us CFR would be standing by and that they had chosen to [request priority handling]. Subsequently Approach asked us if we could accept a visual approach Runway XXL. We had sent for landing data to both XX runways. As our landing weight was 116;400 lbs; VMC weather; and dry runway; we informed them we could accept XXL.The landing gear was lowered in accordance with the QRH. Three down and locked indications were verified. The approach and landing were uneventful. Differential braking was used to taxi clear of the runway. The aircraft was stopped; parking brake set and we contacted operations to coordinate a tow back to the gate.
Aircraft,Number 4 Flight Attendant reported a chemical/dirty sock smell in the aft cabin galley after landing at the conclusion of flight. The smell was reported as persistent throughout the descent/approach/landing. Number 4 Flight Attendant reported a headache and nausea; but refused medical attention. She was driven home by her husband.
Aircraft,Air return due to odor reported by Flight Attendant; multiple customers; deadheading crew; and flight deck. Cabin reported the odor when I contacted them to ask them to stay seated on climb out. The First Officer also inquired regarding an odor. I also smelled something but it was faint at that time. Odor increased on climb out then dissipated but later increased to the point customers were complaining. Aft Fight Attendant stated the odor was increasing and prompted a second flight deck call. I contacted Dispatch and began reviewing the Flight Crew Operations Manual. Odor intensified with water ingestion. Numerous customer complaints as well as Flight Attendants in both aft and forward cabin stated it was increasing while we were reviewing options with ispatch. One customer requested medical attention. Odor was present throughout entire cabin and cockpit and we were unable to isolate the source. We decided to return to ZZZ at that point. Completed all checklist and landed safely in ZZZ.
Aircraft,During descent into ZZZZ; we experienced a fume event that lasted for the duration of the flight and taxi to the gate. Maintenance came aboard the aircraft at ZZZZ and also smelled the fumes and they took the aircraft out of service.
Procedure,Upon arriving at the aircraft; the Captain and myself reviewed the logbook. Upon review; we found a previously written up ELAC fault; and a failure of an elevator servojack. Both of these write ups had been cleared. We noted that the write up of the elevator servojack indicated that the aircraft had reverted into Alternate Law. During our cockpit preparations; a Flight Control Class II message appeared; was written up; and placed on MEL.While en route; during the course of my normal instrument scan; I noticed that an ECAM had appeared for F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; indicating a fault of the Yellow elevator servojack. I should note that the aircraft did not provide any auditory warnings that this ECAM had occurred; leading us to believe that the FWC (Flight Warning Computer) may have failed also.We performed the ECAM actions and reviewed the QRH. This caused us to discuss the fact that this ECAM had been previously written up. We cleared the ECAM item; and shortly thereafter; we saw another ECAM appear.This was the same ECAM of F/CTRL ELEV SERVO FAULT; but now the Green elevator servojack was implicated by the fault. As such; we had now lost half the servojacks on the elevator.At this point; we discussed among ourselves the possibility of the aircraft reverting into alternate law; as this had happened to a previous crew in the previous 2 days. As such; we reviewed the alternate law QRH; and setup the aircraft to land flaps 3 in case we experienced a reversion into alternate law later in the flight. We reviewed the landing distance requirements; and after discussing the issue with Maintenance Control and Dispatch via SATCOM; determined we had the requisite landing distance to continue to ZZZ.No further failures occurred; and we landed without incident. Upon arrival; the Captain wrote up both the servojack failures and the FWC not provided any auditory indications of an ECAM.We briefly discussed the failures with a mechanic; and the crew that was taking over the aircraft.At this point; we proceeded to our next aircraft in order to continue our trip. While we were pushing back; we realized that the aircraft we had written up was also pushing back. This leads me to believe the failed system were simply reset and the aircraft returned to service without troubleshooting.
Human Factors,During initial pushback the pushback driver advised me that we can release the brakes. Once the parking brake was released I heard static on the pushback driver radio and at the same time I noticed we were going backwards. The pushback driver then told us to set brakes and I did. The aircraft rolled back approximately 5 feet. No aircraft damage or personal injury. The pushback driver advised us that the aircraft wasn't properly hooked up to the pushback tug.
Aircraft,I was the pilot flying. Low visibility takeoff from [Runway] XXR in ZZZ. After a 30 second engine run up engines were normal. After v1 at rotation speed we experienced a violent bang followed by a right engine failure with associated yaw and severe vibration. I thought we had hit something during takeoff it was so violent. The FO (First Officer) commented 'what was that followed by engine failure? Flames were reported coming out the tailpipe by Tower. The problem was difficult to identify because the only initial indication was low fuel flow on the right engine; other engine parameters indicated normal. We flew the special engine out procedure. Cleaned up the plane and did the engine fire severe damage checklist. We had an amended release for a takeoff alternate ZZZ1. We requested priority handling and diverted to ZZZ1 climbing to 15;000 ft. The weather at ZZZ1 was VMC and the runways were long cleared. We elected to dump the center tank fuel to lighten the plane for landing. At ZZZ1 we were still overweight for landing so we entered holding and contacted flight control about an overweight landing. We then decided to land on [Runway] XXL AT 335;000 lbs. We landed uneventfully and rolled to the end of the runway where we had fire and rescue inspect the plane and were cleared to parking. This was an extremely challenging worst case scenario with poor weather in mountainous weather and an engine failure right after v1 with a takeoff alternate. The [Relief Pilot] and FO did an outstanding job of helping to identify the failure; run checklists and coordinate with ATC and the company.
Aircraft,During climb through FL340 level 2 Inertial Reference Unit 2FAIL illuminated followed by level 2 LSAS ALL FAIL and YAW [Maintenance Planner] ALL FAIL and an autopilot disconnect. Transferred control to Captain and coordinated a descent to FL270. Complied with all Quick Reference Handbook procedures. Called Dispatch and Maintenance on the SatPhone and with Dispatch concurrence coordinated an [Amended Release] for a return to ZZZ. Uneventful approach and landing at ZZZ.
Aircraft,On approach to ZZZ [Runway] XXL shortly after flaps were selected 35 for landing configuration; we received the Flap Disagree message. On observation of the config page of the system synoptic the flaps were indicating 32 and 29. We executed a go around at approximately 1;200 feet AGL; leveled off at 4;000 MSL. We performed the Slat Disagree checklist.
Human Factors,After landing during the rollout two left main tires blew. We did not know the tires had blown until Tower advised us of our situation. We had already exited the runway then stopped to have the aircraft evaluated by our Mechanics. They decided to put the gear pins in and tug us into parking. The Mechanic advised us no damage to flaps appeared so we retracted flaps and shut down the engines for tow in. We had been on duty since XApm the night before and I believe fatigue played a part in this incident. We were scheduled for three legs and a 10 hour duty day. The third leg ZZZ1-ZZZ led to holding for about 30 minutes. We started an approach then the visibility went below legal. We diverted to ZZZ2 which had been planned while in holding with dispatch. In ZZZ2 Dispatch agreed we would wait out until weather cleared up. The gateway got us some food since we hadn't eaten since XHpm the day before. This pairing had no catering scheduled. We had about 2 hours in ZZZ3 before our flight to ZZZ1. We got the green light to continue back to ZZZ when the incident occurred. I believe we had been on duty close to 13 hours at that point. The weather had improved and the approach seemed stable and touchdown normal. Due to the three MELs we elected to use flaps thirty on all of three flights. The left thrust reverser; all anti skid protection; auto brakes; CAT 3 downgraded; and 1 GPS were all MELd. I believe when I pulled up the 1 reverser I must have applied too much braking action. In hind sight; I wish I had just rolled long and never touched the brakes; however the other 2 legs had been uneventful with flaps 30; 1 thrust reverser; and manual braking with no anti skid or auto brakes.
Human Factors,My crew was assigned to Aircraft X (ZZZ1) turn. The offload showed 28 bags in A1 and 1DG in the AB. I told the crew what was coming off and handed the scanner to the driver; while I went to get the water hose. The water cabinet was blocked by 2 Maintenance vehicles so I had to call for a CSM to come out and have them moved. Being annoyed and distracted about the situation; I proceeded to walk back to the rear of the aircraft as the crew was finishing up with the offloading. I took the ramp link; signed out and told the crew to go in. The flight arrived early; so we had time.[The next] morning before the start of my shift; a ramp CSM came in and told me that she received an email that I had left a DG on Aircraft X yesterday in the AB. I asked her how? She said when the aircraft landed back in ZZZ1 the crew found it in the AB. It was never offloaded in ZZZ.When I approached the rear of the aircraft the crew had just finished the offload. I did not ask the crew if the DG had been unloaded; I assumed it was done. I took the ramp link and proceeded back to the water cabinet to retrieve the water hose. The freight driver was not at the gate to pick up this important [package]/DG. Around XA:00am I pulled up the outbound load sheet. Noticed there were 2 pieces of DG set up for the outbound flight. Which were not on the gate prior to arrival.The ramp CSM notified me that morning and told me we needed to do a Q&A when I had time about the incident. NAME and myself went to the office with the CSM and did the Q & A. When we finished I asked NAME if we could do a [report] on this and he said yes; so he told the CSM that we were going to do the [report]. Due to the ongoing issues system wide and having several new employees I suggest that we remove the SOLID curtain from the rear of the aircraft and replace them with NETTING. I feel that this would simplify things for everyone.
Human Factors,I had been cleared for the ILS XX approach at ZZZ and directed to maintain 3;000 ft. until established. I was in VMC conditions with a broken layer well below my altitude. I was vectored to the final approach course and intercepted it utilizing GPS. Outside the FAF; I attempted to switch NAV sources from GPS to LOC. I believed I had set the NAV 1 radio to VLOC. I later discovered that I had selected VLOC in the NAV 2 radio which was why I was unable to find a LOC 1 setting in my NAV source menu.Switching NAV sources caused the autopilot to disconnect. When I was unable to locate a 'LOC 1' in my NAV source menu; I became distracted by that issue and did not notice that the aircraft had entered a descent. When I did notice the descent; I incorrectly believed I was inside the FAF. Approximately ½ mile outside the FAF; I received a GPWS altitude alert. I responded to the alert by adding power and initiating a climb. Simultaneously; ATC issued a low altitude alert. I advised ATC that I was climbing and requested vectors for another approach. All of this occurred in VMC conditions above a low broken/scattered layer. The subsequent approach was completed without incident through a thin low broken/scattered cloud layer.Learning points. I will ensure that I closely monitor which radio I have configured for the approach. When the autopilot is engaged; I will ensure that I temporarily select HDG mode when changing NAV sources. When I had trouble with the NAV source selection; I should have reengaged the autopilot in HDG and ALT mode while I troubleshot the issue. If the issue could not be troubleshot in a timely manner; it would have been appropriate to request vectors for another approach; this would have provided additional time to identify the issue.While I regret that this incident occurred; I am thankful for my training which enabled me to immediately; and appropriately; respond to the GPWS message. In addition; I am appreciative of the alert ATC Controller who issued the low altitude alert. I am committed to lifetime learning and view this incident as a significant event that will help me be a more proficient pilot. I also plan to share with other pilots so that they may benefit from my learning experience.
Ambiguous,RNAV (GPS) Runway 09R in VMC conditions at ORD. At approximately 300 ft. AGL; received 'Too Low - Terrain' aural warning. Given that we: * had the runway in sight at 15 miles with no terrain obstructions between us and our intended point of landing; * flew the exact RNAV approach profile in VMC conditions; * were stable at 1000 ft. and 500 ft. AGL; and; * were in a perfect position to land safely; I decided it was safe to continue the landing. Received 'Too Low - Terrain' again crossing the Runway 09R threshold at 50 ft. AGL. Landing was uneventful. Additional information: * The following ORD NOTAMS are all valid thru Date 'ILS RWY 09R LOC/GP/DME U/S' 'RWY 09R PAPI U/S' 'RWY 09R ALS U/S' These lead me to believe there has been recent runway construction/expansion. If so; perhaps the EGPWS database does not reflect the change and the runway threshold is not where EGPWS thinks it is. * There was also a '5G' NOTAM; but relief is available via the Company Airport 5G [reference documents].
Human Factors,CA (Captain) taxied to gate following the flight and stopped per marshaller guidance at the gate. Once marshaller gave the stop and chocks in signals; I took off my headset and began to read the shutdown checklist to the CA upon request. As we began the process we noticed the aircraft was rolling back from the gate and the CA applied the brakes to stop the aircraft before it moved more than a few feet. The ground crew plugged in the intercom and advised that they would be hooking up the tow bar and pulling the aircraft forward to the gate. Once the aircraft was pulled forward under tow; we completed the shutdown checklist to completion.CA attempted to set the parking brake unsuccessfully after being given the stop and chocks in signals; which were verified by Station Manager's review of video from the camera at that gate. Station Manager also stated that the aircraft started to move 16 seconds after stopping per the marshaller's signals.Ground crew failed to properly install nose gear chocks after aircraft taxied in. Station Manager stated that the chocks were set on the ground near the nose wheel; but slid out of the way as the aircraft began to roll back from the gate.Pilots need to ensure they check pressure on the brakes when the parking brake is set in the on position. Marshaller's need to ensure that the chocks are installed 'properly/completely' prior to giving pilots the chocks installed signal.
Aircraft,On post flight; Maintenance discovered a slat retraction rod protruding through the skin of the slat retraction panel on the left lower wing outboard of the number one engine.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Encountered wake turbulence on departure. At 1;800 ft. the aircraft immediately banked 30 degrees and was continuing to bank. I disconnected the autopilot and added thrust. We did not deviate from any course or altitude however in order to maintain safety we did not comply with the the noise abatement procedure.
Human Factors,ZZZ1 to ZZZ; we were not serving drinks due to expected turbulence. I made a pot of coffee in the FWD galley to which myself and Flight Attendant (FA) C had one cup. Pilots declined. This pot was then discarded. ZZZ to ZZZ2 we got new pilots. Pilots asked for coffee. I brewed a fresh pot for them and served to them during boarding. On taxi out; Captain (CA) called and asked for us to secure clear zone so he can hand us the coffee as it tastes horrible. I discarded the coffee. At altitude; I dumped the coffee pot and it didn't smell normal. I was thinking that it was just an old coffee pack. Later on; FA-B called me from aft galley stating that both of her coffee makers were making bad coffee as well and that passengers were complaining. I had already served my section but at this point; discontinued all hot beverages. I checked the hot water from the forward galley and the water was cloudy. Pilots were notified.On the Ground in ZZZ2; Maintenance stated that they are emptying the water tank and replacing the filters. Maintenance had the forward galley filter out and said that it was so old that parts of it are missing. He couldn't get the filter out of the socket it had been there that long. We had a crew change at this point; so I am not sure as to what else was discovered at this point.
Human Factors,Crew was briefed on job assignments for inbound Aircraft X arriving from ZZZ. After all cargo was unloaded crew member failed to check aft bulk on A321; resulting in leaving one 34 lbs box restricted article on plane in the bulk compartment.Did not know event occurred until I was notified by a CSM on date.Failure to check aft bulk on the aircraft for any possible cargo that could be loaded in this location.Inbound Aircraft X was turning to ZZZ1. I assume crew offloading flight in ZZZ1 found the 34 lbs box.On all A321 aircraft solid net separating A2 from bulk should have netting similar to net separating A1 from A2. This way person loading aft compartment has a clear view of the bulk. There have been many occurrences through the system with the same problem; with cargo being left in aft bulk; because agent unloading aircraft forgetting to visually check behind solid net.
Human Factors,We was towing Aircraft X to cargo XX. Myself and another Wing Walker and the Crew Chief went to North Cargo XX ahead of aircraft to set up. I was wing walking on the left side of the aircraft. When I looked over to see the Crew Chief holding up the x for stop. I then yelled to the Tow Driver to stop through wireless headset. Myself NAME; NAME1 and NAME2 was involved. While wing walking I looked over to see the Crew Chief holding up the stop sign. Then the aircraft collided into the Company cart. Arriving to North Cargo XX; there was a Company cart in the area where the aircraft would be. I moved the cart to what I thought was a safe place. There was a Manager already on the aircraft conducting an audit. Explained everything to the Manager and the Manager notified every one else.
Human Factors,I did not witness this; I was told after it happened: '#1 tire came loose; while towing airplane from bay to blast fence. Loud popping sound was observed and upon investigation; found #1 tire cockeyed. Removed hubcap and found axle nut completely removed from axle; possible thread damage on axle and axle nut; outboard bearing inboard and outboard retainer and seal damaged; axle nut locking bolt sheared; brake assembly damaged.' 'They observed that the incorrect axle nut may have been possibly installed. This axle was modified and requires the reworked axle nut assembly (yellow colored) but white axle nut was installed and appears to have much play possibly leading to this incident occurring.'I was called to give ok to install the #1; #2; #4 and #6 wheel assemblies of the left Main Landing Gear. I gave them the ok to install and went on other job calls. When the tire installations were completed; I returned to the left Main Landing Gear to verify that all four tires were installed. I did not see the nut installation since the hubcaps; clamps and lock wire were installed. I believe more training is required on how to identify the proper hardware to use on the Main Landing Gear.
Aircraft,I noticed a slight chemical smell during taxi. On takeoff and during climb the smell became very strong. I spoke with the Captain and he stated that he and the First Officer could also smell it in the cockpit. The decision was made to return to ZZZ.
Human Factors,We had pushed back and started engines. Ramp control issued us clearance to taxi to Spot XX via CS. As we were passing [a] Gate an airplane which had pushed back did a 180 deg turn and started to taxi into us. We were moving at ~10 kts. and almost abeam the [other aircraft] when Ramp instructed us to stop and allow [him] in front of us. I had to turn towards the middle of the Ramp and slam on the brakes. The [other] airplane stopped too. After a long pause Ramp told [the other aircraft] to hold and directed us to continue to [Spot] XX.
Ambiguous,Was executing the ILS 28 CAT 2 into SYR. Had everything hooked up for a CAT 2 approach...first approach got to about 180 ft and auto land red light illuminated without and other warnings. We went around.  RVR was still low; came around and tried same approach again. Got same thing at the same altitude on second approach went around again. Went out and visibility came up enough to do a CAT 1 we did that and landed out of that approach.  Called Maintenance Control talked about the issue with the auto land light. He said no anomalies he could see...just wondering if this had anything to do with 5G cellular signals.  At the same time we were having these issues [another] aircraft also coming into SYR was having some sort of issue.
Ambiguous,After receiving a clearance from ORD approach to conduct a RNAV approach for Runway 9R; we were able to execute a fully stable approach.   We then received clearance to land from ORD tower control and as we continued a stable descent below 500 ft. towards the runway; we received two abnormal terrain warning around 300 ft. AGL; that false warning discontinued around 250 ft. AGL. Furthermore; as we continued the descent toward the runway around 50 ft. above the Runway 09R threshold we received another single 'Too low terrain' warning.  Situational Facts: We were in VMC at all the time.  5G related NOTAMs were in effect.  Full AMOC (Alternate Methods of Compliance) approval.  Since we were in VMC and were in safe position to land the aircraft we decided to continue the approach and land safely.
Aircraft,During preflight; smoke reported in cargo area. Evacuated aircraft. Called fire department. Cause was an APU fault.
Aircraft,During departure while climbing out of ZZZ; we got a 'flaps fail' message. We ran the QRH and determined the right flap was at 2 degrees; left flap 0 degrees. ACARSed  Dispatch; Did some calculating and determined we had the fuel to continue to ZZZ1 and there was no safety of flight issue. [Advised ATC] to have the trucks standing by in ZZZ1. Made a 0 Flap landing on Runway XXC without incident; did not overheat the brakes; [notified ATC] and taxied to the gate.
Human Factors,Terrain Warning during visual approach to Runway XX during base leg. Descended early to compensate for close-in vector assigned during visual approach.Suggestion - Closely monitor altitude and descent rate relative to terrain depicted on chart.
Aircraft,We were level at 10;000 feet MSL with Departure Control. We were initially on an RNAV departure but given a vector to turn northward and to delete the speed restriction. This is what they normally do. Nothing unusual so far but as I initiated the left turn to the assigned heading and increased power the aircraft pitched upward rather aggressively. The autopilot was already engaged. It was working normally but for some reason the aircraft pitched upward. We both noticed this and by time I reacted the aircraft pitch attitude was continuing to increase to about 10 degrees nose high before I was able to disconnect the autopilot and take control manually. I pushed forward; trimmed downward; throttled back but by then we were at least 500 feet above our assigned altitude. In the whole process I noticed the amber trim warning light was on momentarily.I'm experienced; have flown for over X years; with approximately 29;000 hours and flew military aircraft for X years with the military and airlines for X years and have not experienced this before. I informed Departure that I had a trim control problem and they asked if I needed any further assistance to which I said I did not. The aircraft was back under control. We had a team of doctors on board; a transplant team. All were okay.I guardedly reengaged the autopilot and there were no additional occurrences and the trim light had already gone out. It was a stand alone occurrence with no forewarning. During the rest of the flight I disengaged the autopilot and ran the pitch trim and reengaged it two or three more times with no unusual occurrences. I'm not sure what caused the issue. In my airline career I was a functional check flight Captain so I am very aware familiar with flight control and trim systems. All I can figure is that possibly the automated trim system rate of response during the turn and thrust increase for some unknown reason could not keep up.
Airport,Aircraft X was taxiing via the North Route and did not stop at Taxiway November 2 as published on the 'North Route.' I have notified local safety chief pilots as this has been an ongoing issue. They have coordinated with Jeppesen to highlight the North Route in bold font. Two of the pilots have suggested that LAWA (Los Angeles World Airports) enhance the sign at 'Checkpoint One' to include verbiage that instructs pilots to stop short of Taxiway November 2 and contact Ground frequency on 121.65. I have notified local management and their suggestion was that I file a report when this happens.  I will continue to report this issue as it happens frequently.
Procedure,Before Aircraft X was switched to Local frequency; the Tower team noticed that Aircraft X was below the MVA and struggling to maintain the correct altitude for the ILS XX approach. We had been listening to radar and noticed no low altitude alert was issued; when required; and/or he wasn't cleared for a visual approach when they had the airport in sight. When Aircraft X checked on to Tower frequency; we used our gut instinct and verified Aircraft X still had the field in sight and cleared him for the visual approach.[I recommend to] follow the FAA directives and issue low altitude alerts when needed to help pilots safely navigate the NAS.
Airport,Aircraft X was taxiing via the North Route and was told to standby. Rather than stopping short of November 2 as is instructed in the North Route; they continued their taxi. Aircraft Y (a reposition aircraft) was on ramp frequency and was approaching November 2 to enter the ramp area. Aircraft X cut off Aircraft Y. I have notified local safety chief pilots as this has been an on going issue. They have coordinated with Jeppesen to hi-light the North Route in bold font. Two of the pilots have suggested that LAWA (Los Angeles World Airports) enhance the sign at 'Checkpoint One' to include verbiage that instructs pilots to stop short of Taxiway November 2 and contact ground frequency on 121.65. I have notified local management and their suggestion was that I file a report when this happens. This was the additional information I was sent from management. Additionally; the issue should be sent to our suggestion program (9-AWP-LAX-Suggestion@faa.gov). If the Joint Sponsors (JS) accept the issue; they will create an issue statement which will then be forwarded to the LSC. It may be sent to the Procedures CWG as well; however that is up to the JS. Either (or both) CWGs should then coordinate with LAWA (and possibly other entities) in regards to correcting this ongoing issue. I will continue to report this issue as it happens frequently. I have sent an email to the suggestion program.
Human Factors,At approximately 100 kts.; during takeoff; ATC advised us to 'Stop'. I saw the aircraft enter the runway and rejected. After communicating with ATC; we talked with the Flight Attendants [and] passengers [and] ran the brake cooling numbers. Before departing we contacted Dispatch; talked also with the Chief Pilot on Call. No issues; continued to destination without further incident.
Aircraft,Aircraft X pushed from the gate at ZZZ and prior to engine start encountered a left Wing-body overheat indication. Dispatch and Maintenance Control consulted and the left pack deferred under MEL. Aircraft Bleeds and packs configured in accordance with MEL. Release 2 with deferral signed. Departure to the south; climb to initial altitude. Re cleared to 13;000 feet en-route to ZZZ1. Passing 10;000 feet cabin altitude and pressurization checked in accordance with SOP; cabin altitude 2;000 feet and differential pressure indicating that the aircraft was pressurizing. Contacted center and cleared to final cruise altitude of FL230. Passing 17;000 feet rechecked cabin altitude/differential pressure; cabin altitude 6;000 feet and differential pressure same as it was on the 10;000 check. Asked for final cruise altitude of FL190; granted. At level off; cabin altitude 8;000 feet and differential same as at 10;000 feet; check. Requested descent to 10;000 feet and cleared to 13;000 feet. In descent to 13;000 feet cabin altitude warning horn/light sounded and illuminated. Immediate action items complied with and descent to 10;000 requested again and granted. Checklist completed and warnings extinguished. Passenger masks did not deploy. [Requested priority handling]; flight attendants briefed. Talked to passengers. Rest of arrival [was] uneventful; landed and taxied to gate. Write up completed; Chief Pilot debriefed; Dispatch debriefed; ZZZ1 maintenance debriefed face to face in Operations Control.
Aircraft,On the climbout at around 17;000 feet while on the L autopilot control yoke started to bump very slightly forward every few seconds; CA (Captain) switched to the C autopilot; same issue. Then switched to R autopilot the problem seemed to be resolved. Continuing on the climbout; at around 23;000 feet; the Captain's EFIS started flickering and as we climbed further the flickering worsened. We requested to level off at 30;000 feet and do a present position hold. Captain assigned the flying duties to me at this point. As we leveled off; the L GEN fault light illuminated and fault showed on EICAS; L CTR tank fault light also illuminated. As the captain was going through the QRH to resolve the issues; we agreed on [requesting priority handling] and return back to ZZZ. We prepared the airplane for arrival back to ZZZ. Captain briefed the FA and accomplished all the QRH; including the overweight landing checklist. Before commencing the ILS to ZZZ; we switched pilot duties and Captain assumed control again of the aircraft. Landed successfully in ZZZ.
Human Factors,During radar vectors to final approach for FLL ILS 10L; Miami Approach provided a call out for unknown traffic type 2;500 ft. (500 ft. below). Told to maintain 3;000 ft.; then provided vector 190 [degrees] base turn to final. Received TCAS Traffic Alert immediately followed by RA on 190 [degrees] roll out heading. TCAS indicated said aircraft as 400 ft. below. Pilot Flying disengaged autopilot and auto throttles followed TCAS RA guidance to remain clear of traffic. Approach acknowledged RA and advised turn to 160 [degrees] when able and clearance for ILS.
Procedure,Flying ILS 9C. At 4000 I noticed the GS signal moving abnormally fast from full up deflection to downward as we intercepted the GS. The movement was so fast the GS captured quickly and the aircraft pitched 5 degrees nose down (AP was on). The FO (First Officer) disconnected the AP but initially continued to follow the FD until I commanded him to pitch up and recover. Once stabilized flight was regained; I noticed an aircraft taxi south across the approach end of the runway on Taxiway Z. We both attributed the erratic GS to this aircraft. Once the aircraft cleared the runway; the signal appeared normal. We continued the approach in VMC. Approximately 2 miles from EZELL; I noticed we were approximately 2200 ft. MSL which is 200 ft. lower than we should have been when on the GS. I attempted to determine what was wrong and visually confirmed we were low by looking at the PAPIs. When we passed EZELL; I noticed we were only 1350 ft. AGL (200-300 lower than we should have been on the GS). I verbalized this to the FO who seemed distracted with the obvious irregularity. We extended the gear and flaps and were fully configured by 1000 ft. The FO disregarded the GS and flew the remaining approach visually. I again noticed another aircraft holding short of [Runway] 9C on Z Taxiway which I assumed caused the GS error. I reported this to ATC which seemed unconcerned and mentioned that an aircraft had not stopped in the correct location. Shortly after; another aircraft; who had heard our transmission; advised ATC that they experienced the same issue. Clearly this is a very unsafe situation and could have numerous consequences. In IMC; we would have gone around. It also may have resulted in a CFIT escape.
Aircraft,While at a cruise altitude of FL340 we received a call from the lead Flight Attendant stating that there was visible smoke in the cabin and also a burning electrical smell near the front of the cabin. The Flight Attendants in the rear of the aircraft said they could also smell a burning smell. We had no indication of cabin smoke in the cockpit or any sort of fire alerts. We went back and forth between planning a diversion and talking to the Flight Attendants about the smoke in the cabin which the lead Flight Attendant advised was still visible. We communicated with Dispatch our need to divert and land the plane as soon as practical. We made a decision to [request priority handling] to ZZZ and have [airport support personnel] equipment standing by. We preformed all necessary checklist for smoke/fire in cabin; Flight Attendant briefing; passenger notification; overweight landings and diversion prior to landing. On our way to ZZZ the lead Flight Attendant advised us that the smoke was no longer visible but there was still a burning smell. After landing the aircraft; the rescue and fire trucks inspected the exterior of the aircraft for any indication of fire. After the [airport support personnel] advised us there was no sign of fire; we proceeded to the gate to park the aircraft. After parking the [airport support personnel] came on board the aircraft inspected for any fire; smoke or areas of burning equipment.
Ambiguous,After a normal flight and initial portion of the approach and configuration into MIA I asked for gear down and flaps 15 at about 1500 AFE and the CA (Captain) complied and at about 1200 AFE I asked for flaps 30 and the landing checklist.  When the CA started to run the checklist we both noticed that in addition to the 3 green down and locked lights; the 3 red gear disagree lights were also illuminated.  There was a very brief discussion about the fact we had 3 green lights on the forward panel as well as 3 green on the overhead panel; so we were sure that the gear was in fact down and safe but were both unsure as to why the gear disagree lights were on.  Shortly after that we began to get and EGPWS warning 'Too low gear.'  We again double checked that we had 6 green lights which we did; but the 3 red gear disagree lights remained illuminated.  As the warning continued I asked the CA something to the effect of 'do you want me to go around;' to which he replied something to the effect of 'no; we know our gear is down and locked; land.'  I felt uncomfortable; but did not voice any further objections and continued to land.  The landing was normal and upon landing the gear disagree lights extinguished.  The remainder of the flight was normal.  A ELB entry was made and the CA contacted Maintenance.
Human Factors,Undeclared Dangerous Goods was found at ZZZ in Mail tendered in ZZZ1 by the USPS for Aircraft X connecting to Aircraft Y.
Aircraft,On short final on a visual approach for Runway XXR approximately 500 ft. we got GPWS 'too low terrain'. Aircraft was stable; on glide slope and PAPI; continued to normal landing. After departing ZZZ we were given multiple reroutes and also held on the STAR. Fuel remaining; thunderstorms in the area and the volume of arrivals were factors in decision to land.
Aircraft,While descending trough approximately 11;000 ft. and transiting a thin cloud layer; a noticeable chemical odor was detected in the cockpit. Immediately selected ENG BLEED 1 - OFF and PACK - OFF. Then referenced  Flight Crew Operations Manual Odor Recognition and Isolation Guidance step 9; selecting X-BLEED - SHUT and then ENG BLEED 1 - ON. Odor dissipated after approximately 1-2 minutes from initial actions. Upon arrival; momentarily selected PACK 1 - ON. Odor immediately returned. Selected PACK 1 - OFF again and accomplished Guidance step 14. Logbook entry made; Fumes Report completed and discussion with Maintenance Control personnel.
Aircraft,Green hydraulic system failure. ECAM - hyd g rsvr lo level and hyd g eng 1 pump lo pr. Actions coordinated a hold with approach control to hold over ZZZZZ to afford us the time to troubleshoot and coordinate a plan prior to our approach into ZZZ. Executed the 'non-normal' associated with the above ECAMS. Based on the status of the multiple failures associated with loss of green hydraulic system we declared flight 54 a priority aircraft with approach control for planning purposes. Contacted ZZZ Maintenance on VHF to foster a cohesive plan and review of the potential steps we would anticipate prior to our approach into ZZZ. Highlighted items discussed were alternate gear extension and no steering capability which will result in being towed off of the Runway. After discussion with Maintenance discussed the plan with my First Officer to find a shared mental model on which approach and expectations/cautions in what to anticipate before and after landing. I then followed up with communicating with the flight attendants providing them the test and then communicating with our customers. Approach phase coordinated a minimum of a 10 mile final with ATC. Actively reviewed and recalled ECAM ACTIONS with First Officer. Anticipating executing the Alt gear ext procedure we recalled the status page on lower ECAM related to approach procedure; ECAM directs us to turn on no.#1 eng hydraulic pump. Upon doing so; all malfunctions and status items were cleared and found normal. Landed with no degradation and taxied on our own power to the terminal. Advised flight attendants to remain seated and all was ok.
Aircraft,On the takeoff roll; we received a caution and ECAM message 'HYD Y RES LO.' We elected to continue the take off as this was the safe option. We cleaned up and completed the after takeoff checklist. We ran the ECAM and QRH procedures uneventfully. After a SATCOM patch was initiated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control and in concurrence with all concerned parties; we elected to return to ZZZ. We were heavy weight so we had to burn down gas. Based on available landing distance and landing weight considerations; we elected to burn fuel down and land at a 158;000 pounds gross weight. Subsequent approach and landing were uneventful. We requested priority handling so that Crash Fire Rescue could be present and check the brake temperatures. Landing vertical speed was no more than 200 FPS. After landing; the brake temperatures never went above 500 degrees C. We taxied on our own power to local Gate X. Subsequent walk around inspection by both pilots revealed a blown hydraulic line in the Number 2 engine.
Aircraft,This event occurred after a Gate return that was not associated with this event in same aircraft however. Upon takeoff bleed 1 over pressure illuminated. I ran the QRH and had a negative attempt to reset the bleed. QRH directed us to leave and avoid icing. Our destination was not the best choice with our malfunction. We asked dispatches opinion and they requested ZZZ which we agreed with. We diverted back to ZZZ.
Procedure,We took Aircraft X in ZZZ1 from another crew that was deadheading on our flight to ZZZ; the previous Captain had written up the aircraft due to the emergency/parking brake light illuminated during take and in flight; Maintenance came out; took the parking brake handle apart; clean a sensor; and Operations check came back good; we departure ZZZ1 and everything was normal until about half way through the flight; at cruise of FL210 the emergency/parking brake light illuminated and we got the EICAS message parking brake not released; I as PF (Pilot Flying) called for the QRH and the checklist was run by my FO (First Officer); after cycling the brake handle; the message and light extinguished ending the QRH procedure; we started our descent shortly after this; during the descent; the light flicked on and off several time but the EICAS; never came back on during this time; after being clear for the approach; the light flickered several times and the EICAS message came back on; but turned back off shortly after; as I was calling for gear down the light and EICAS message came back on; and stayed on; I cycled the brake handle one last time but this time it did not clear the message; we initiated a go-around and asked for delayed vectors to run the QRH for the second time; I took the radios and my FO ran the QRH; I made an announcement to the cabin; after running the QRH procedure the message did not clear and the light stayed illuminated; we decide the best plan of action was to request priority handling as we did not if the brakes were engaged or not; I communicated with the cabin crew about the situation; they prepared the cabin as the FO and I prepared for a second approach; we followed the guidance of the QRH for speed and aircraft configuration and preceded with the approach; it was decided to use a brace call due to the fact that we didn't know if the brake was engaged or not; at roughly 30 seconds before tough down; I had my FO call the brace since I was the PF; touchdown and roll out was normal; during the taxi in; the parking brake not released message extinguished and was replaced by a emergency brake fault message; we taxied to the gate without further incident.This event highlights a couple of things for me as Captain; overall I think my crew did an outstanding job handling the situation; from the go-around to communication between the cockpit and cabin to preparing the cabin to the brace being called; but there are a few things that I think can be brought to light; 1st. We had a prejudice about the message since it had been written up in ZZZ1 and had happen to us in cruise; so when it happened on approach I made the decision to drop the gear to see if that would clear the message; instead I should have initiated the go around instead of continuing the approach; 2nd. When called the FAs (Flight Attendants) using the Emergency call button I gave them the NTSB information as I have done several times in the simulators; when I got to the brace call I said I don't anticipate a brace call; as we finished getting ready for the approach it dawned on me; I didn't know if the parking brake was engaged or not; just because this happened on the previous flight and it went away and cleared for us earlier doesn't mean that we don't have a real problem with the parking brake being engaged; I believe I didn't this again because of the prejudice I had that it was just a sensor problem; but I didn't know; I treated this message as if we had the parking brake engaged in every other aspect except the brace call; after this realization I called back my FAs and told them we will be bracing; another aspect of this that I have realized is my calls to the cabin; I had been told years ago tell the cabin you will be landing and that CFR will be there to look at the aircraft; but not to tell them too much as we don't want to scare them; I did talk over the PA several times; but I believe I didn't tell them enough about what was going on; I did tellthem that CFR would be meeting us to take a look after we landed but not much else; I believe I could have worded my announcement better to bring more comfort to the passenger which I overlooked due to the stress of landing a plane potential with the brakes engaged; this was the first time I have had to [request priority handling] as Captain; and it was an incredible learning experience that I will not soon forget.
Aircraft,While climbing out of ZZZ approximately FL200 the Captain mentioned his flight displays were flickering. Then approximately FL250 we had a L GEN FAIL EICAS along with associated load shed messages; the captain ran the QRH for the L GEN FAIL and power was restored. About a minute or two later; all the instruments started flashing as well flags on the round dials; both left and Center CRTs were flashing as well. The Captain turned off the left generator and all but the load shed items came back online. Once he started the APU the load shed items came back online also. We [requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ.
Aircraft,On climbout; through the low twenties; I notice a quick flicker of both my PFD and ND.  Somewhere between FL250 and FL280 we got a L GEN OFF ICAS message with associated messages. We ran the QRH which called for a one time reset of the left engine generator. Generator came back on line and messages cleared. About a minute or two later both left and both center screens started flashing on and off repeatedly as well as flags on all instruments.  I tried assessing our situation but was unable to read anything on the ICAS.  It was flashing on and off.  This continued until I turned off the left engine generator.  Then it stabilized; all screens returned and flags stowed.  Only the load-shed items remained off line. I started the APU and load-shed items returned.  We returned to ZZZ.
Human Factors,After pushing back; start; and initial taxi on the ramp; we had not received final weights. Using radio 2; I called operations to get a status on the weights. I was also using radio 2 for CTAF advisories. After getting the final weights; we proceeded to taxi from the ramp onto Taxiway 1 for Runway XX (the runway of choice for inbound and departing transport and business aircraft). This route crosses active Runway YY/ZZ (the runway of choice for general aviation aircraft). Before crossing [Runway] YY/ZZ; we cleared both left and right; I made the call on the CTAF that we were crossing and crossed the runway. As we crossed; we saw a small aircraft already on the runway and possibly taking off. I didn't hear any calls on the radio and then realized I was still on the operations frequency. I made the advisory on the operations frequency and not CTAF. The small aircraft then taxied to the ramp from the approach end of [Runway] ZZ. I'm not sure if that aircraft aborted the takeoff or was simply taxiing to the hangar but it was an incursion nonetheless. The small aircraft was difficult to see and seemed to blend with the background buildings quite well. And coupled with my radio call error; we indeed had a runway incursion.
Aircraft,My First Officer and I were on final approach to land at ZZZ; and got a gear disagree indication for all three gear when the gear were extended. Simultaneously; we got all three gear down and locked indications on both the forward and overhead panels. I know from my systems knowledge that the green gear down and locked indication; from either the forward or overhead panel; means that the gear is unquestionably down and locked; regardless of the disagree light status. Therefore; after a brief discussion with my First Officer we agreed that continuing to a landing was a safe course of action; so we continued the approach and the First Officer landed the airplane. We received GPWS warnings; 'Too low; gear;' as we neared the Runway. After touchdown those warnings ceased and the red disagree lights extinguished. I submitted a Maintenance defect and called and informed Maintenance.
Aircraft,Rotation on takeoff; noticed pullback on left engine followed by popping sound and subsequent compressor stall message. Requested priority handling ran through QRH; checklist; returned to ZZZ without further incident.
Aircraft,Upon the initial climb at about 600 ft. MSL the crew received an EICAS message: 'rudder overboost'. The crew identified and cancelled the caution; flew the plane above acceleration altitude; and continued on course with a normal climb profile. The PM ran the QRH for 'rudder overboost'. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) followed the QRH and pushed the Rudder Sys 2 Shutoff PB out; and the EICAS message rudder overboost disappeared. Then; the message 'rudder sys 2 inop' appeared on the EICAS. That was the end of the QRH. The PM sent a message to Dispatch above 10;000 ft. to let them know. The flight continued normally; the crew; aka the pilots; dispatch and maintenance; worked well together and showed CRM. Maintenance was in the know thanks to Dispatch. Upon the plane's arrival to ZZZ1; dispatch notified the pilots that a repo plane was already on it's way to ZZZ1 to replace the broken airplane. As far as threats were involved; there were gusty winds in ZZZ2 upon departure. There were no errors observed; and no Undesirable Aircraft State occurred. The plane landed safely in ZZZ1.
Weather,Due to encountering moderate to severe turbulence enroute to ZZZZ with a resulting overspeed event requiring an inspection; the operational decision was made to divert to RKSI. While keeping the safety of flight as the primary intent; it became evident that the diversion to RKSI was in the best overall interest considering: the amount of time the aircraft would need to be grounded for a maintenance inspection; crew duty limitations; fuel and weather factors; and our customer's needs. The Chinese ATC was very helpful and accommodating with our diversion request.While operating as the relief crew in cruise flight at FL351 (10;700 meters) over China we encountered moderate to severe clear air turbulence. Airspeed rapidly increased through the Maximum Speed indication to at least 340 kts. indicated; and the overspeed warning sounded. Crew coordination and control inputs were applied to stabilize the encounter. The airspeed remained above the Maximum Speed indication for a number of seconds before dropping down. The airspeed then dropped rapidly past the airspeed bug and the stick shaker was activated for a brief second requiring continued control inputs by the PF (Pilot Flying) to stabilize the situation. Once we cleared the turbulence (or what appeared to be a strong rogue wave of air) and stabilized the airspeed; we reported the encounter to ATC. Another aircraft approximately 5 minutes ahead of us at 11;300 meters reported a windshear encounter to ATC just before our report. We performed the Overspeed non-normal checklist. We then woke up the PIC (Pilot in Command) and FO (First Officer) of the flight who were in rest and briefed them of what had occurred. We then contacted Company Dispatch and informed them of the occurrence. The operational decision was made to divert to RKSI due to the reasons mentioned above. We concurred with the decision and diverted to RKSI. The remainder of the flight was uneventful. After we blocked in we made an appropriate entry into the aircraft log for an inspection.1. Be more cognitive of and place more emphasis on areas of forecasted turbulence while route planning our flights. 2. Better turbulence forecasting technology.
Aircraft,I was flying with Captain Name and we were taxiing for takeoff on Aircraft X ZZZ to ZZZ1 on Date at approximately XA:00pm CDT. When arrived at the Aircraft Maintenance Personnel were working on the Aircraft due to a write up from the previous crew regarding brake system. During the taxi out the brakes were locking up on both brake pedals and the plane was violently dipping it's nose. We decide to stop the aircraft and set the parking brake and shut off the engine on Taxiway 1 just short of 2 in ZZZ. We turned on the APU and waited to be towed back to the Gate. Captain wrote the plane up and we left after debriefing the maintenance technicians. When I was doing the preflight the Maintenance Personnel asked me if I saw anything wrong with the brake system. Also; they returned to the flight deck three times during the boarding process to check on the plane. Usually; this doesn't happen. They fix it and leave. The BCSO (Brake Control Shut Off) faulted out which caused our number two brake to lock up and slid down the taxiway. I'm glad it happened on the ground and not on landing. We never received an ECAM or any alert to our failure; which is not typical in the Airbus. More research on known brake issues. I don't think the mechanics were happy with their fix to the situation. Hence them returning and waiting for the plane to leave before their departure.
Human Factors,On the arrival the copilot abruptly pushed the plane over in a descent. I knew we had to start down but I thought it was a little aggressive. When I looked up he was calling out traffic 12 O'Clock high. All I saw was a windscreen full of color X and color Y aircraft; close enough to easy read the numbers on the side of the aircraft. I felt we missed that plane by 50 to 60 ft. I thought he was going to hit our tail. But no noise. The Copilot stated that he had a hard time calling out the traffic because he was responding to the threat. We were both very startled by the appearance of the plane. The other aircraft did not have a transponder on; there was no TCAS alert and ATC did not have them on radar. I reported the issue over the radio when I got my heart out of my mouth.The only factor was that other aircraft was not using a transponder. Had the Copilot been looking down or had not caught it; there could have been two aircraft down this evening.The copilot was flying and as a former military instructor pilot he kept his head on a swivel during the descent. Thank God for that and he saw Aircraft X and reacted very quickly before we smashed into the side of the plane. Today he saved two planes and people on our aircraft. Suggestion: All light GA aircraft should have a transponder on when flying across an arrival corridor and the exact altitude that is published for the arrival fixes.
Aircraft,At 1;500 feet AGL on final to ZZZ XXR I called for 'Landing checklist - below the line'. At 'Flaps' it was observed that the flap handle was at 30 but the flap position indicator displayed flaps 1.We elected to increase airspeed to the white caret on the airspeed indicator and proceed with the landing. We did not set the Ground Proximity Flap Inhibit switch to 'Flap Inhibit' which resulted in receiving the 'Too Low - Terrain' aural warning. The aircraft was on profile so we ignored the warning and landed normally; with a slightly longer than normal rollout.After touchdown the 'PSEU' (Proximity Switch Electronic Unit) light illuminated and the flaps moved to 30. We were able to raise the flaps after clearing the runway; subsequently the 'PSEU' light extinguished.Cause - We elected to land in lieu of going around in an aircraft with unknown possible flight control issues. Aircraft was on profile on a clear night with light winds and a long runway. The alternative was to take the aircraft back into the air to perform the QRH procedure and attempt an alternate flap extension procedure.Suggestions - This would be a useful training scenario.
Aircraft,We had a smoke; odor & fumes event.This was not a A320 dirty socks event... on approach about 6;000 AGL I was notified of a faint electrical cord burning smell in aft cabin/galley area. I told the FA's (Flight Attendants) to keep me informed if it got worse and we would land in a few minutes.I was told upon arrival at the gate the FA's speculated it was probably smell from a passengers older laptop (FA's said faint electrical burn smell in back of aircraft that went away fairly fast). I speculated it was possibly pollution smell as we were on descent well below 10;000 ft.The FA's did report that they turned off the passenger charging ports when they detected the smell  I noted this in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry and report.No passengers or crew reported ill effects.Dispatch notified; Aircraft Maintenance Logbook entry made; Smoke; Odor & Fumes form completed; and conference call with Maintenance Operations Center and [Checklist] completed upon arrival per Flight Operations Manual.
Aircraft,As per previous report; lost flight instruments approximately 40 miles west of ZZZ. We sent a message to operations. Due to loss of instruments had to hand fly in to ZZZ area. Operations says they lost operational control. I disagree. We sent the message and due to loss of instruments and high work load; we had no more time to discuss.
Aircraft,APS (Automated Performance System) required a max thrust takeoff from XXR due to the meteorological conditions at the time (rain and wet Runway). I verified the engines were spooling up appropriately prior to releasing the brakes and pushing the thrust tile. Approaching 80 knots. I had not heard 'thrust set.' I looked to verify and saw the left engine was at the required 1.72 EPR; but the right engine was only at 1.62 EPR. I advanced the right thrust lever to the stop with no change. Going through 80 knots; it was obvious thrust was not set and in the interest of safety I called for and initiated the reject around 90 knots. My decision to reject was based on a potential engine failure and or aircraft unable/unsafe to fly situation. Once the reject was ensured; I kicked off the auto brakes and rolled the plane down to Taxiway 1 and had my First Officer (FO) advise Tower of the reject. At the completion of the Rejected Takeoff and after landing checklists; I asked my FO to monitor the radios and run the brake cooling charts while I called Dispatch. We took our time to complete the QRH while monitoring the BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System). Since we were not within the caution or fuse plug melting zone; we determined it was safe to coordinate a block turn back and returned to the Gate. Current maintenance history shows engine runs with similar EPR numbers to what we experienced. It appears a faulty fuel flow governor and high pressure fuel pump is the issue.
Aircraft,At FL390 the autopilot did an uncommanded disengagement and we received a sel elev feel man (Select Elevator Fell to Manual) Level 2 alert on EAD (Engine and Aircraft Display). The aircraft became more difficult to control. The aircraft began to decelerate. We avoided a stall using the AOA reference. We completed the QRH for the sel elev feel man Level 2 alert and discovered the First Officer side airspeed indicator unreliable. We then completed the QRH for Airspeed Unreliable. We requested [priority handling] and landed uneventfully at ZZZ.After the event; I was very thankful for the training I received on unreliable airspeed events. I feel that the sim training helped us identify the unreliable airspeed problem more quickly; which is something that is not immediately obvious to a flight crew. I really feel that the simulator training contributed to the positive outcome of this event.
Aircraft,Phone patch at XA40Z. got the Supervisor and Maintenance on the phone. 2 air system fails. Red lights on. At XB08Z Supervisor and Maintenance and Dispatch all concurred to return to ZZZ due single pack only and the risk of losing all pressurization and needing a divert over remote areas of ZZZ2 and ZZZ1. Priority handling never requested. Supervisor and Operations informed.
Aircraft,In cruise at FL410 over ZZZ we got an EICAS message for cargo smoke. There was no smell or sign of fire so Captain went to see if fire was present and I put on O2 mask. Upon his return he reported smoke in cargo area to me. We requested priority handling and initiated a descent for recovery at ZZZ1. We were quickly vectored in for a visual approach to Runway XX ZZZ1. Services were on the spot for us on landing. I prepared for an evacuation during approach. We elected to clear the Runway and stop on Taxiway as we still had no visible sign or smells. As we stopped the pax reported smoke now present. I got up and opened door and directed them down and to a safe area. Captain shutdown and helped direct pax and I showed fire rescue cargo area from inside plane. They requested I open the outside cargo door and I did so. They started pulling the luggage out looking for source. There was a 3-4 inch burn mark on left side of cargo bay wall and bedding bag had some burn marks but no flames were present. Passenger were picked up by FBO and we took the plane back to the FBO with fire rescue escort. Aircraft is in maintenance with Company now. Our Company was notified and in contact with us through all on ground. ATC did a great job in getting us down safely in a high traffic area. Fire rescue response was also great. The Company was very responsive and helpful in guiding us through events.
Aircraft,After the previously reported rejected takeoff; I received re-release and prepared for departure again. Having just experienced the door opening on the takeoff roll due to what I assumed to be personal negligence in verifying the door's closure; I checked and triple checked that the latches were fully engaged. In the initial climb phase of flight I noticed a hissing noise; and felt air coming in through the crew door. I pulled on the door handle to see if the door would seal better; but when I let go of the handle; the door opened violently and came off at the hinges. This happened at about 3000 ft. MSL a few miles south east of ZZZ. The wind blew my headset off and was causing papers and loose objects to fly around the Cockpit; so I reduced power to slow down and mitigate the wind in the Cockpit. I did not initially adjust trim enough which caused a descent to about 2600 ft. MSL while I found and donned my headset; at which point I informed approach that my door had fallen off and I would be returning to ZZZ1. I initially became aware that something was not quite right when I could hear and feel air coming in through the door during climb. I believe there was a mechanical failure with the door latch mechanism. Immediate air return to ZZZ1. Perhaps the door would not have opened if I had not attempted to pull it tight when I realized it was not sealing properly. All I can think of is that by doing so; it relieved pressure off the hooks and allowed them to fall back enough that they could not engage properly when I stopped pulling on the door handle. If a similar situation occurred and I noticed air coming in through the door; I would not touch it at all and return preemptively to have the door inspected.
Aircraft,During our takeoff roll on Runway XX at ZZZ at around 50 or so knots a Left engine fire RWP was noticed along with the associated Fire Bell and master warning light. The First Officer (FO) who was the PM on this leg called out the RWP. I announced the abort and we performed the memory items for the rejected take off and engine fire prior to V1. The FO announced to the Tower Controller that we were aborting the takeoff. We came to a stop on the Runway and idle/cutoff the engine. The FO pulled and ran the QRH and at that time we noticed the Left engine fire RWP indication extinguished after the left engine was shut down. We exited Runway XX at Taxiway 1 and stopped. We asked the Tower Controller at that time to send an available Ops vehicle for an inspection of the left engine prior to returning to the Gate. ZZZ Ops didn't see any visible damage. Contact was then made to Tower to return to our Gate. The FO phoned Dispatch while I communicated with the Flight Attendants and ultimately announced to the cabin that we would be returning to the Gate after an abnormal indication during our take off roll. We taxied back to the gate on our remaining engine with no further issues.
Aircraft,On DATE; approximately at XA00 est; the Flight Crew experienced a minor gear malfunction departing ZZZ. The occurrence began on the taxi in on the previous flight where the crew received a landing gear no dispatch caution message as soon as the crew shut down engine two on the taxi in. The message only lasted a second and cleared itself. The crew presumed it was due to a bad power transfer. After parking at the gate; again; on the previous flight; when the crew switched to ground power and there were multiple caution messages that populated the EICAS during the power transfer. These messages only lasted a seconded and cleared itself. Moving forward; Aircraft X to ZZZ1 was fully boarded and at 10 minutes prior to push; the crew received a message from Dispatch to not close due to a disabled aircraft on the only runway in ZZZ1. Eventually; the crew deplaned to wait for a positive update. After a few hours of waiting; the crew was good to board and continue the operation. The flight continued on the ground without issues until shortly after takeoff. The FO (Flight Officer); Pilot Flying; called for gear up and the Captain quickly noticed the landing gear lever was stuck in the down position without a single EICAS message. The Captain declared to fly the aircraft first and to relax especially since the flight was on a RNAV departure. After being handed off to ATC; the captain reminded the FO that he has the aircraft and reported the abnormal to ATC. The crew continued laterally on the SID and was granted a lower airspeed. The Captain opened to the non annunciated chapter of the QRH and quickly found the correct procedure. After completing the procedure and establishing a plan amongst the flight crew; the flights destination was changed to ZZZ. ATC provided the longest runway in ZZZ and the crew accepted and began setting up for the approach. The Captain; when asked; decided to request priority handling to ATC in order to have additional resources on the ground. The Captain identified this occurrence was minor and assumed it was just a bad weight on wheel sensor. However; the Captain also identified the following facts: the crew as a whole was slightly fatigued from the long day; the crew's stress from multiple abnormal operations; the FO and A flight attendant's low experience and the captain never experiencing this failure before. After landing and exiting the runway; the Fire Marshal inspected the landing gear mainly for foreign objects. During this time; the aircraft received ENG 1 and 2 NO DISPATCH; and FLT CONTROL NO DISPATCH caution messages. Ensuring the Flight Attendants; Passengers and Operations were updated; the QRH procedures were completed; the flight continued to the gate where eventually the passengers were deplaned and Maintenance grounded the flight.Moving forward; I received a great deal of experience with the abnormal and believed the crew as a whole handled it very well. I knew studying the non annunciated checklist was important and allowed the crew to take control of the event safely and efficiently. Without all the threats previously mentioned and the experienced gained; I may not request priority handling for a future occurrence of the like. Lastly; I believe some seemingly erroneous EICAS messages during power transfers that instantly clear themselves should be reported to Maintenance. If this was done; the event as a whole could have been avoided.I believe some seemingly erroneous EICAS messages during power transfers that instantly clear themselves should be reported to Maintenance. If this was done; the event as a whole could have been avoided.
Aircraft,We taxiied out and had to drive before takeoff due to the heavy snow. Then FA's (flight attendants) in the back called me to please come to the back to see if I could smell the fumes. I smelled it right away; started burning my chest; yes; nose.. started to feel nauseous as well as the 2 FA's in the back. We notified Captain immediately; he let us know that we were no where near any other aircraft and which way the winds were blowing and the fumes seemed to be coming from the deicer truck etc. He flushed the aircraft and that helped a lot. After take off we the crew checked on each other; Name1 was still feeling the effect of the fumes as well as me. Name2 was feeling a little dizzy but it went away. (Name3 could smell it as well while on the ground and passengers when she went to check as well towards mid cabin; it was really strong) So after takeoff; it was OK and we got a lot of fresh air. During decent after 10k I went to the back to check on the FA's and we could smell once again strong fumes. I mentioned it to our Captain and he wanted to make sure we were all OK and I let him know we have to report it. And he said that's good; they need to do an air quality check and left. We are now waiting for our ZZZ1 turn. No one met the plane and asked us about this. Do an air quality test on aircraft and notify Supervisors and who was suppose to meet us.
Human Factors,FA's (Flight Attendants) needed to remove and check 7-8 bags from the aircraft; since we ran out of OHB space. FA's brought the bags to the boarding door. Unfortunately; the Agents did not ask any customer about spare lithium batteries being in their bags; as all the Customers were seated. There were no conversations with any of the passengers and their checked bags and the bags simply were tagged and sent to the ramp. This is not good as this created a safety hazard. Please ensure all Team Members follow procedure; most especially when it pertains to safety-related items and the integrity of the aircraft; as it did in this case. Friendly and continuous reminders are always helpful. In hindsight; I wish I would have informed the Captain about this at the time; but there was a lot going on: we had all these bags saturating the galley; it was near departure time; I had to go brief OWE's (Overwing Emergency Exit); etc. However; I'm not sure if that would have changed anything in the end anyway. I really truly wish we all were aware of procedures and followed procedures even when it might be inconvenient or we miss departure time. It is very difficult and challenging to confront Team Members asking them to follow procedure when we really shouldn't be having to ask them to; we should all know procedure and follow it without question instead of taking the easy way out. I share this with your Team in confidence: I did receive some pushback from a fellow FA when I mentioned asking those 7-8 passengers to go to the boarding door with their bags. I hope this remains confidential. Perhaps this is a good opportunity for us to remind each other of the need to always follow procedure regarding bags that need to be removed from the cabin due to lack of OHB space; most particularly on the A319/320 aircraft where space is always limited. I can't do everything myself :( Thank you for your continued help and support. Please let me know how I can help you as well.
Aircraft,[Requested priority handling] for landing gear failing to extend. Checklist used to alternately extend the landing gear. Subsequent landing and taxi were uneventful.
Human Factors,During the descent on radar vectors to intercept the final approach course for Runway 4 going into HOU; we noticed a drone of our left wing at the same altitude (4100 feet) we were descending through. We estimate that the overall size of the drone was about 12 inches. The coloring was white and we could see red lights on it. We did not have to change course; nor did we have to make evasive maneuvers to avoid it. We estimated that we were less than a quarter mile away from it. We immediately notified Houston Approach and informed them of our encounter. We were just a few miles west of the AXH airport.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Aircraft X ZZZ1 to ATL on (date). Approximate arrival time of XA:20 L. Conditions were IMC with heavy rain and ceilings around 1;000 ft. AGL. Winds were 130 degrees at 15 knots. The descent and arrival were quite turbulent as a frontal line was in the process of passing through the ATL area. We were cleared to intercept the localizer for Runway 8L in preparation for the ILS. The approach itself was nominal. We began to break out of the weather at approximately 2 - 3 miles from the runway threshold. The Pilot Flying (PF) remained on instruments. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) began to crosscheck outside the aircraft looking for approach lighting. At approximately one mile from the runway threshold; the PM noticed a large electronic billboard with bright red lights. We think the billboard is on SR 6 (location pulled from VFR chart on JeppFD-Pro X). It faces to the west. Simultaneously; the PAPIs came into view and; of course; had red lights in view. The red billboard lights were MUCH brighter than the red PAPI lights. The PM realized the opportunity for confusion as the meteorological conditions had put both pilots in the 'Yellow'. He advised the PF to NOT focus on the billboard. In spite of this warning and due to the brightness of the billboard and the fact that it was red; the PF's attention was initially drawn to the billboard and away from the instruments. Acknowledging what happened verbally; the PF focused his attention back inside the aircraft and on the instruments. The approach and landing continued uneventfully. We are submitting this report to bring to your attention the potential confusion the billboard could cause an aircrew when looking for the PAPIs in low visibility conditions. The billboard is bright enough that one's eye could be easily drawn to that billboard; thereby potentially causing an aircraft deviation from the approach. Recommend someone take a good look at the billboard in question to ensure it is not a safety issue for crews in IMC flying this approach in the future.
Aircraft,This report is to document our diversion back to ZZZ. At FL 340 we encountered a window overheat light followed by a loud POP. The loud pop was followed by about a dozen cracks across the Captain's front windscreen. The First Officer and I agreed that we would prefer to return rather than fly another four hours to ZZZ1. The Captain talked with Dispatch and Maintenance while the First Officer talked with ATC about turning back to the east. Initially we asked for divert to ZZZ2. After calculating a rough fuel burn we consulted with Dispatch and Maintenance; we slowed the aircraft down; descended to a lower altitude to reduce the pressures on the Captain's window. We did not [request priority handling] as it was the outside window pane that was cracked; not the interior window pane. Our weight was over the max structural landing weight; so instead of holding we decided to burn the fuel down as we changed the diversion field to ZZZ. This allowed us to have more opportunity to check landing distances and max brake cooling procedures. In hindsight; we should have clarified our ask with ZZZ1 Center and ZZZ Approach as we did not require holding to burn the extra fuel. Instead; we descended to a lower altitude and lowered the gear down to burn fuel more quickly and land sooner. Landing at ZZZ was uneventful and the aircraft returned to Maintenance.
Human Factors,Showed up to originator with compressed timeline due to short overnight and lack of food and coffee options in the hotel and airport. Upon arrival I missed the fuel leak from the #2 Engine. This was pointed out from ramp and required Maintenance to come out. These issues lead to us missing that the aircraft terminated with 58% oil on #1 Engine and had not been serviced. After pushback and engine start; Mechanic signaled that the leak from #2 was within limits and we were cleared to operate as normal. On departure out of ZZZ; due to light aircraft weight; there was a high angle of attack on departure. While switching to Departure frequency; I noticed the engine indications beginning to flash; which showed our #1 engine oil quantity dropping to approximately 2%. With crew coordination we continued to fly the departure while monitoring all other engine indications; which remained normal. As I flew; the Captain opened the QRH and we agreed to lower the angle of attack and reduce power while troubleshooting. This caused the oil quantity to increase and the flashing engine indications to cease. We agreed that with normal indications we were okay to continue and maintained a lower angle of attack on climb out. The Captain sent a message to Dispatch; requesting oil service in ZZZ1 and we landed with no further abnormal indications.Be more vigilant during perceived compressed timelines situations. All Crews aware of terminating oil quantity levels to prevent downline issues.
Aircraft,The Captain was the Flying Pilot and commenced the takeoff roll at approximately XA58Z. Both engines accelerated normally. Just prior to 100 kts. a power transfer occurred that resulted in the RH GEN falling offline along with both utility busses shedding. I announced the malfunction and the Captain continued the takeoff. During the climb out the Captain had me start the APU. After climbing to approximately 3;000 ft. the Captain turned on the AP and transferred aircraft control and radio duties to me. The Captain accomplished the appropriate checklist and shortly afterward the Generator failed again along with the Generator Drive. The appropriate checklist was completed. The Flight Attendants were notified of the problem. Dispatch and Maintenance were contacted and a diversion plan formulated to return to ZZZ. Meanwhile I coordinated with ATC for holding instructions to burn fuel to get to max landing weight. After holding the Captain again became the flying pilot and we proceeded to ZZZ for an uneventful landing. After landing the Captain conferred with ZZZ maintenance on the maintenance write up.
Weather,Crew sent ACARS at XA31Z stating they experienced windshear on departure out of ZZZ. They also stated that they [requested priority] with ATC as airspeed and altitude were temporarily unmanageable. Crew states aircraft was fully under control at 4;000 ft. I relayed information on to Operations and completed a report into Dispatch Center. I also called Maintenance Control and informed them of the situation and they said they would have Maintenance take a look at the aircraft in ZZZ1. My relief then came in for Shift Turnover. I briefed him on the desk and what happened with the flight. Shortly after turnover; I got a call from Operations asking if crew had rescinded their [request for priority]. As I already turned over the desk; I informed my relief to query the crew if they rescinded; and left for the day.
Aircraft,While at cruise at FL 340 the number 1 engine started rolling back. We pushed the throttle up but the engine continued to rolled back and eventually failed. We ran the Engine Failure Checklist and then the drift down checklist. The engine indications were normal so we descended to FL 240 to attempt a restart because that was the top of the inflight restart envelope. It seemed to be starting normally except we never got light off so after 30 seconds we terminated the restart attempt. We had sent several messages to Dispatch but ACARS coverage was pretty spotty. We eventually got in touch with Dispatch and agreed ZZZ was a good diversion destination. We had already [requested priority handling]. ATC cleared us directly to a fix on the final approach for the ILS XX. Since I had just finished recurrent last Wednesday I became to pilot flying. Name; the First Officer reviewed all the checklist I had already done and previewed the single engine landing checklist plus we both reviewed the single engine go around if needed. Flew a flaps 15 single engine approach and landing without incident. Exited near the end of the Runway and taxied to a parking spot. Spoke with the Chief Pilot; Maintenance Control; and the crew desk. Overall other than the spotty ACARS coverage I think it went very well.
Aircraft,On initial descent into ZZZ; descending out of FL290 we noticed a flashing green oil qty indication at 4 qts on the right #2 engine. Our initial thought was to continue to ZZZ which was 130NM away if the oil qty stayed at 4; however the oil qty continued to drop at a rate which required action on our part to avoid a possible engine failure. I then became Pilot Monitoring; and after [requesting priority handling] with ATC we asked for vectors to ZZZ1. I spoke to Dispatch on the radio to tell them our issue and planned divert. We continued our accelerated descent into ZZZ1 as oil qty continued to drop. The pilot-to-pilot interaction was busy and communication to one another was adequate. The First Officer then asked for a 360 turn around 10;000-15;000 ft. to give us extra time. I did not think a 360 was a good idea as we were [a priority] aircraft and I felt getting closer to the airport was a better course of action. A potential error was the pilot-to-pilot communication together on the best way to get to the airport the fastest; but it was quickly agreed on to go direct.I then assumed PF (Pilot Flying) duties and asked the FO (First Officer) to discontinue the 360 and get vectors for a right downwind for Runway XX and selected an airspeed above 250 kts. to get down to altitude for the FAF. Going above 250 kts. surprised the First Officer; but I indicated we were [a priority] aircraft and getting down to altitude was a priority by going above 250 kts. We did not let ATC know of our increased airspeed; but things were busy and they were giving us vectors to get established on course at our request. Our vectors took us to right base and then final where we marginally overshot the Runway XX final approach course by 1-2NM as I was trying to get a little more time to slow and configure; almost an S-type maneuvering; and we were cleared for the visual approach. Configuration on final was properly done with no over speeds and good aircraft control; at this time we still had good oil pressure; but oil qty was now indicating 0.0. We were stable at all-gates on short final and we landed successfully. On taxi-in we decided to shut engine #2 down to prevent possible damage. We had no ECAMs during the flight; we thankfully maintained oil pressure during the flight; but on the post flight aircraft inspection there was noticeable oil loss as seen by oil leaking out of the right engine cowl.
Human Factors,For my final flight of the day I felt very overwhelmed without any assistance. All day I was bounced around to cover other gates and at one time felt very under the weather. I tried to do too many tasks to get the flight ready for pushback; but it seemed like my Lead was walking away for other stuff. I got very stressed once my headset wasn't working so I had to wait for my Lead to bring another. After realizing it worked I proceeded to get ready for push; but once again my Lead had walked away unannounced. I became more stressed and pressured since the Captain made it clear he was ready to leave. I then told the Captain he could release brakes and after doing so I noticed the plane moving; but I was not. In an immediate panic I jumped out and threw a chock behind the wheel. We properly connected the towbar after the incident and called for Maintenance as a precautionary measure.
Aircraft,We were given clearance for takeoff and proceeded to taxi onto the runway. The Captain was PF (Pilot Flying) and applied power for takeoff and takeoff thrust was set. At 80kts I said '80kts' and he said 'reject' at which point we rejected the takeoff and slowed the aircraft and I let the Tower know we rejected. I asked the Captain what he saw and he told me the airspeed was well over 300kts so that's why he rejected the takeoff. Because of our 80kts cross check we avoided a very bad situation that could've happened if we did not have the check.
Ambiguous,Cleared for takeoff [Runway] 27L and assigned a left turn heading 230. When First Officer (FO) called 'Positive Rate'; I noticed radio altimeter was reading -4. Cross checked FO's radio altimeter and appeared to be operating normally.  When I called heading selected 230 the flight director only commanded a 8 degree turn. Above acceleration height; I asked the FO to reference my radio altimeter. The FO observed -4 and then a blank alternating on Captain (CA) radio altimeter; while FO's appeared to be ops normal. All the while the flight director CA was not commanding a lower pitch for flap retraction. Crew ran QRH checklist for Radio Altimeter Failure and reported possible 5G issue to ATC. We suspected 5G interference because; although FO's RA appeared normal; the 8 degrees AOB and wrong pitch attitude commanded by flight director appears to correspond to the additional info note from QRH procedure. Ops normal approach and landing ZZZ. Suggestions.  Need more information on 5G affects on Commercial Aircraft.
Aircraft,Previewed aircraft X for morning flight while still at hotel. Contacted Maintenance due to lack of details on previous flight return to Gate - maintenance write up. Found aircraft had history of candle lighting (fires in tailpipe) - most recent event had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) intervention during taxi out when fire was identified by preceding aircraft. This engine had also been written up for having Teflon contamination and had been identified for expedited engine swap. (Within 5 days). After conferring with Maintenance; Dispatch; Duty Pilot; and eventually the local ZZZ Maintenance Supervisor; I felt that the tailpipe fire issue; although addressed; didn't give me adequate assurance that the situation was unlikely to occur again. This; coupled with the impending engine swap; led me to believe this aircraft did not provide the safety margin I thought was adequate for revenue passenger travel; and refused the aircraft.Aircraft refusal was result of an engine due for maintenance and a previous event on that engine. I have expanded some thoughts in the Suggestions sections of this form below.Although seemingly unrelated; I would assume most aircrew are reluctant to depart on revenue flights with aircraft that have multiple engine anomalies. Especially those that have experienced repeat events. I was also not convinced that the leaking oil issue that was causing the tailpipe located fires was accurately and completely addressed. The optics of the situation; (where the aircraft was subject to an engine swap within five days); may lead one to infer (correctly or not) there may be reluctance to perform major maintenance on an engine that is due to be removed shortly; and lead to increased aircrew refusals of aircraft.
Human Factors,Passing through 7;000 feet on arrival MIA observed a drone off left side of aircraft; we were on a westerly heading. Need more info and regulations on drones in terminal areas.
Aircraft,Operating Aircraft X ZZZ1-ZZZZ with MEL XX-00-01; which rendered the L Generator INOP; we received an APU OIL QTY status message (APU was operating per MEL) and a few minutes later the APU auto shutdown. We ran the QRH and [requested priority handling]. We evaluated our options and chose to divert to ZZZ since it was good weather and approximately 110 miles away and we were at FL350. Approach was uneventful and we elected to land overweight at XXX;XXX pounds due to being single generator ops. Landing and taxi in were normal with no other issues.
Human Factors,While boarding passengers parked at gate in ZZZ; plane was struck in the right winglet by a local base company de-ice truck. Truck was backing up while de-icing the plane at gate. Passenger boarding was stopped and all passengers were asked and reported to be okay at the time of the incident. Passenger were then deplaned and incident reported to company. No fluid leaks or potential hazards were identified at the time.
Aircraft,In cruise to ZZZ1; Parking Brake Not Release EICAS message was displayed. The parking brake light was going on and off constantly. QRH didn't solve the issue. We couldn't determine the actual status of the parking brake. We elected to [request priority handling] and return to ZZZ. Flight Attendants (FA) were informed and given 40 minutes to prepare the Cabin. A brace command was also issued. Flight landed without incident. Fire and Rescue was called for a precautionary visual inspection. After the all clear we taxied to the gate and deplaned. Crew handled the situation perfectly. Company procedures document was good for delivering effective communication to Flight Attendants. We slowed down to give FAs enough time to finish their checklists.
Aircraft,Aircraft X landed at ZZZ and #3 brake assembly was found damaged and parts of the brake were found on the ramp and the brake was seized to tire and wheel assembly when trying to replace the brake. Upon further investigation [Name] and I accomplished a quick search on the 737 MAX aircraft and found that there is a history of damaged and seized brake assemblies on the 737 MAX Fleet. For example [similar problems affecting five other B737 MAX aircraft] were found during a quick history search. Someone needs to look into this matter more deeply and further investigate why the 737 MAX brake assemblies are being found seized and damaged to the point where they are breaking apart and debris found on the ramp.We need a deeper investigation on the brake assemblies that are being installed on the 737 MAX Aircraft as we are finding these brake assemblies breaking apart and/or damaged during aircraft arrival. It could either be a bad batch of brakes; brake failure or a systemic issue with these carbon brakes on the 737 MAX Aircraft. This needs to be investigated as soon as possible to avoid a possible accident.
Human Factors,I was working with Avionics Tech Name; we accomplished both Task Cards. XX-XXXX-X-XXXX and XX-XXXX-XXXY. This was a quick turn back to terminal. I signed off both job cards on my IPAD and realized that I made the mistake of signing for both EEC (Electronic Engine Control) 1 and 2 existing fault checks that were ETOPS issued work. I should have Read and understand task card.
Human Factors,I was the brake rider on [gate] XX; Aircraft X. We were having some problems with the headset so we switched headsets twice. After that; I called for reposition to the Tower; thinking we ready. The Tower gave me the ok after I called; but in the process of calling my foot was on the brake pedals and somehow I took the brakes off. I realized the plane was rolling back and my coworkers gave the sign to put the brakes and I did. By the time we went back to tow team room our Manager call us [and] ask us what happening.
Human Factors,SIC lost brake control while attempting to hold short of Runway XX at ZZZ. PIC took control and aircraft crossed hold short line and went slightly over Taxiway line but remained on tarmac. Tower was notified and an ERJ on final was told to go-around. PIC performed brake check and determined we could continue with flight. Tower cleared us to takeoff and we proceeded to ZZZ1. Upon arrival in ZZZ1 significant damage to propeller was noticed.
Weather,Flight XXX; Weather: 050/16G26 1/2 -SN BR FG BLSN OVC09 -4/-1 A3013 RXX RCAM 3/3/3 TYPE II & TYPE IV Application (Holdover: XA:05-XB:00) Began Type IV XA38 (Holdover: XR43-XU38). After receiving Type II & Type IV; the Captain (CA) determined that the winds (a tailwind added to the already less than desirable weather conditions) did not favor a Runway XX departure therefore; we requested Runway XY. While taxiing (from Taxiway 1-2-Runway XY at approximately XS50); I remember thinking to myself; 'Okay; we are going nice and slow; this is not too bad; the tires are gripping nicely'. As we approached the departure end of Runway XY; the Tower cleared us for departure and the CA asked me to respond that we needed a minute and wanted to know the winds again. The CA then came to a stop and made another assessment and told me to let Tower know that we were ready. The CA started to make the left 90 degree turn to line up onto the runway; but; because we were moving so slowly; I did not realize that the CA was trying to keep the aircraft from sliding until; in fact; it was sliding and we were moving towards the right edge of Runway XY and the runway sign was at our nose. At that time; the CA deployed reverse thrust and we both applied full brake pressure. The aircraft came to a full stop at a 45 degree angle to Runway XY and approximately 2 ft. from the runway edge with the aircraft nose just shy of the runway sign. We did not depart the runway pavement and the aircraft did not make contact with any lights/markers/signs. The CA's slow taxi to line up and his quick response and reaction to the situation; averted what could have been a more serious situation. The RCAM condition reported (3/3/3) was nowhere near the actual conditions of that runway; it was a sheet of ice which; with the BLSN; was not detected until we attempted to taxi onto it.
Ambiguous,We departed DXB at max gross T/O weight 407.4lbs the First Officer was the Pilot Flying and I was the Pilot Monitoring. We climbed at 320/.78 to FL240 per the flight plan. When we switched to Bahrain Control they asked if we could accept FL300. I looked at the VNAV page in the FMC it said max FL was FL32.1. So I accepted the climb clearance. Climbing out of FL290 we started to encounter turbulence. As we leveled at FL300 the aircraft started to accelerate to Mach .82 per the flight plan as soon as we leveled off the turbulence be came continuous the aircraft tried to overspeed. The Pilot Flying opened the speed window to .78 and manually pulled the thrust levers back to midrange maybe slightly more. Then the turbulence's increased to moderate. The aircraft was pitching up and down +/- 3 or 4 degree's and the wings rolling +/- 20 degrees trying to stay leveled at FL300. Then; the autopilot disengaged we received the master warning for autopilot disengage. The aircraft had started to descend. The Pilot Flying then selected the vertical speed as the aircraft had started to slow down and descend. When the vertical speed button was selected the aircraft had a Ivvi of 800ft to 900ft down due to the turbulence. I the Pilot Monitoring saw what had happened and re-selected the C auto pilot and immediately selected flight level change. The lowest I saw the Altimeter read was 29;700ft. Bahrain Control said he showed we had descended enough to get an Altitude warning. I called Bahrain and reported moderate turbulence and at this point I had started to suspect it might have been wake turbulence from a Heavy Jumbo that had departed DXB ahead of us. We were in continuous turbulence so we requested a descent to flight level 280 with the ride improving in the descent. The rest of the flight was uneventful.
Ambiguous,During departure on 17R via the APALO6; NAV didn't capture the SID but remained in the ARM mode. Disengaged the autopilot and commenced a turn to the right at the same time ATC queried if we were on the SID. We replied that we were in a right hand turn at which time ATC cleared us to APALO and gave us a # to call once on the deck in ZZZ. Reading the latest 5G interference bulletins; this could have been a cause and effect on the lateral guidance mode.
Human Factors,Electronic Load Manifest versions 1; 2; and 3 stated NO Dangerous Goods Form. Per AOM procedure; after closing the L1 door and walking the deck; the Relief Pilot noted a strong chemical-like smell coming from one of the containers near position L18. I confirmed that I too smelled something toxic; such as acetone; and requested the Load Supervisor remove and inspect the container. Instead of removing the container; loaders opened it inside the airplane (further exposing ramp personnel and crew to the noxious fumes). With the main cargo door open and the front of the container open; the noxious smell was now almost overpowering (While wearing my N95 mask; I could still smell the fumes and started to experience a physiological responses - my eyes started to tear). The Ramp Supervisor showed me the boxes in the front of the container and said they were ink cartridges. He said since the front row looked okay; the container should stay onboard. Some of the boxes in front were deformed; and we were unable to see the boxes in the back of the container to see if any had broken. I declined to take the container on my airplane without identifying the cause of the fumes. All operating crew members could smell the strong odor. The Mechanic concurred he could smell it too. As the last line of defense - for safety of flight reasons; the strong presence of odor; the lack of willingness to comply with my request to remove the container and determine the cause of the fumes; the attempt to bully and intimidate me and my crew into taking this suspect container; I insisted; for a second time; on the removal of the container from the airplane. I also requested with Operations; the Load Supervisor; the Mechanic and the Assistant Chief Pilot that the container needed to be unloaded to find the cause before further transport on an aircraft (I don't know if that occurred). (I would not drive my car with a smell that strong; much less consider taking an airplane across the ocean for 9 hours with limited divert options).Once the container was removed; the odor completely dissipated; and we departed soon after. The rest of the flight was fume free and uneventful. This delay could have been decreased exponentially had the Load Supervisor immediately complied with my request to remove the suspect container and inspect it outside the airplane after we departed. Additionally; no safety (hazmat/dangerous goods) procedures were followed once I informed the ground personnel of noxious fumes and a strong odor coming from a container. For further information; please refer to the HAZMAT CREW PROCEDURES; and one will see that that a strong odor is an indicator of DG incident. The most likely indications of a DG incident in flight would be the detection of a strong odor; or by the illumination of the cargo fire/smoke warning.The Captain (or B747 qualified designee) walks down the side of the main deck to check for unusual/suspicious packages; smoke; fumes; heat or obvious damage; and that the load is secure. First; when a crew member states there are noxious fumes coming from a container and need it removed; this request should be complied with immediately for the safety of all concerned. Opening a container inside the airplane that reeks of chemicals is not the proper protocol. Second; develop some type of checklist for when a crewmember identifies a suspect container. Third; do not try to bully and intimidate a Captain to take an item that is unsafe. Respect her authority as the Captain of the airplane. Fourth; regardless of what item are in the container (ink cartridges or even 'bamboo cartridges') if the container reeks of toxic fumes; it should be removed.
Aircraft,Nearing TOD and after descent from FL380 to FL360 R engine indications became erratic; thrust vector and thrust setting disagreed. Thrust lever response became limited. The R engine reduced to idle and remained unresponsive for the remainder of the flight. All engine indications were normal for flight idle. The Captain ran the Engine Limit Surge Stall checklist; no favorable response. [Priority handling requested] with Center. We observed intermittent lights on the electrical and hydraulic control panels along with a R GEN OFF EICAS message over a 15-20 second period and then the lights went away. We descended; prepared for; briefed and flew the ILS X into ZZZ. On landing; crash observed the R engine; nothing noted. On taxi-in; R Engine became responsive again.
Aircraft,FO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying). On takeoff; shortly after rotation and main gear liftoff; we received 'TAT Probe' EICAS message with associated Master Caution. SPD mode on FMA went blank. We both verified all three airspeed indicators and concluded all three were indicating correctly. A few moments later; we received 'L ENG EEC' and 'R ENG EEC' EICAS messages. At selection of VNAV; we received 'Autothrottle Disconnect' EICAS message. We then received an 'FMC Message' EICAS and noticed fuel prediction and ETA times on FMC Progress Page were blank. I immediately asked for radar vectors for a return to ZZZ. FO continued as PF and did an excellent job of maintaining aircraft control while I continued the PM (Pilot Monitoring) duties. After discussing our options; we both agreed returning back to ZZZ was the safest course of action; especially not knowing what other aircraft system we could lose. While receiving extended vectors for the ILS XXL; we accomplished all Normal Checklists; contacted Dispatch; and accomplished the corresponding QRH procedures. I decided I would do the landing in the event other system would malfunction during the approach. ILS approach and landing were normal and uneventful.
Human Factors,Parked in assigned slot at ZZZ. FO (First Officer) started APU on taxi in. I noticed this when we parked so I shut down both engines. I elected to hold brakes because we had limited time on ground and were scheduled to take the same aircraft to ZZZ1. We had brakes temps on the right and we waited for the Ramp Personnel to chock the aircraft. The Ramp Personnel were taking a long time to chock the plane. Suddenly I felt the brakes become 'squishy' and we started to roll backwards. I looked at the gauge and realized we had NO pressure. The Mechanic and Ramp Personnel were screaming at us as the airplane rolled backward. I was dumbfounded as to what had happened. Feeling helpless I tried to figure out what would cause this and looked up. All of the hydraulics were shut off! I asked why this was like this and the FO stated that he had performed the shutdown and secure checklist. I had NEVER called for this; as we were not even chocked in. We turned the hydraulics on and I was able to stop the airplane. We had moved back several feet and I had to restart the right engine to pull forward. I am writing this so that it does not happen to someone else. Through no action or direction of my own; I would have been responsible for possible personnel or equipment damage. This highlights the need to only accomplish these items when they are called for. I routinely operate into ZZZ2 followed by a turn to ZZZ3 where we ALWAYS hold the brakes and NEVER set the parking brake because we will damage the brakes. I was completely blindsided by this because I did not see the action completed. I was watching outside; waiting for chocks in signal. I am just glad we saw this and were able to avoid a mishap. Nothing was damaged; no violation occurred but hopefully this will allow someone else to know where to look should this happen and we can prevent it from occurring with reminders that these actions should not occur without direction. Thank you.
Human Factors,Issue with no parking brake at engine start...and tug not attached.  Pushed out of ramp X; spot XX.  Tugged all the way back to the center line...even thought that we were really going for a long push back. As we stopped moving backwards; mechanic stated cleared for start.  (While I would like to say that I am 100 % sure he did not say parking brake set; there is just the smallest chance I may have missed something. but I am pretty sure I did not say parking brake set to his call for it; as I would have set the brake).  With that; it is normal to start the engines while still hooked to the tow bar/tug. Just because you are cleared to start does not mean you set the brake.  So number 2 started normal; Cleared to start number 1. As number two spooled up; with both myself and the FO monitoring the gauges for the start; the mechanic excitedly called us and told us we were moving; twice very rapidly. brakes were applied to stop very slow roll; then parking brake set. Roll was very short and slow as we did not feel it.  No issues for remainder of start. I cleared off the mechanic and taxied normally; a little flustered; but normal.We talked about how this could happen; did I not set the brake? Did I not set it all the way? Why would I not set the brake? Did he call for the brake to be set?  Like I said; I may have been at fault; and I take full responsibility if so; but I feel that since I did not get a parking brake set call from the mechanic; the brake issue was out of the normal habit pattern. Hence; we had no brake set after the tug left the aircraft during start.  I am not trying to point fingers; hopefully not at myself; but this was one of those cases where a call was missed and the Swiss cheese lined up.  We as a crew talked about how to handle this type of situation in the future.  In the future; we are going to try and be a little more aware of our out side situation after a cleared for start while still hooked to the tug. It's interesting how easy something like a missed call can get you out of your normal habit pattern; and while this was an attention getting moment; we were lucky that we were not near anything and that the mechanic noticed the slow roll.
Aircraft,While on final approach to Rwy XXL I (First Officer/Pilot Monitoring) noticed that the right flap indicated 25 degrees while the left flap indicated 30 as selected. The Captain (Pilot Flying) elected to go around. I informed Tower that we were going around and with the Captain's concurrence [requested priority handling]. We ran the associated checklist and discovered it was an indication malfunction only and not an actual asymmetric flap condition. As we were being vectored around for another approach the right flap indication moved to 30 so it matched the left. Once all checklists were complete we landed without further incident.
Weather,We taxied out for takeoff for Runway XX and the ramp was covered with snow and the airplane was not sliding. Once we were cleared for takeoff we taxied on to A to line up with the Runway and airplane was not turning. I advanced the right engine thrust to help us turn and that and that still did allow us to turn. I noticed we were going towards a runway sign so I advanced reverse thrust to keep us from hitting the sign. We came to a stop and we called Tower. We found out that we didn't leave the pavement and didn't damage any taxi lights. We got towed back to the ramp.
Aircraft,Scheduled to operate Aircraft X. Got to the gateway on time XA30 pm and there was light rain on the field. By the time we were loaded up the rain changed to a very heavy snow. The weather was calling light snow -3C. The snowfall intensity table entering those conditions showed it to be moderate snow and gave me a holdover time of 30 minutes to an hour. I called my Dispatcher and he agrees. We then pushed back to taxi to the de ice station. During taxi the snow had already piled up and the breaking action became nil. I slid to a stop and set the brake and reported to Ground. They sent snow plows to me and cleared me a path back to the parking spot. It was just coming down too hard and I figured the runway would be bad also. I figured that even though the weather was calling light snow; in my judgement it was actually heavy snow with a rapid rate of accumulation. We made it back to the gate and waited 4 plus hours for the conditions to improve. And to allow them to plow the field.During this time I worked with Dispatch and also informed Operations of our situation. The airport was putting out very different runway condition reports so it was hard to determine safe and legal. Reports were rapidly going from 3/3/3; 1/1/1; 6/6/6. There were 4 other flights dealing with the same issues as me. The Company flights cancelled at around XC00 pm and us and the 2 cargo Jet planes sat at the ramp waiting for the conditions to get better. After the long wait the snow let up a bit and all surfaces had been plowed so I decided to try again. I had the numbers I needed. One of the cargo jet had already taxied to the de ice pad and I asked him how the taxiway was and he reported them as fine but they were returning to the gate because their snowfall intensity table was more restricted than mine they needed 1 mile visibility for the weather to be considered moderate snow I only needed 3/4 of a mile. I then taxied to the de ice station. It took about 1.5 hours to de ice. The snow never stopped but was going back and forth from heavy to light.After we were de iced we were cleared for takeoff and the visibility was 1.5 miles and the runway was plowed. After liftoff we couldn't retract the gear. Due to the icing conditions; I was now in an urgent condition and needed to get on the ground fast. We [advised ATC]; asked for immediate vectors back to Runway XX ILS Cat 2. The weather app on my EFB showed tops to 15000 to 25000 ft. and the storm went for hundreds of miles around me so where I took off from was my best bet to get out of the ice. We threw in the approach; quick brief; ran all checklist; checked for any checklist guidance on the gear but found none. We tried twice to get them up but only the doors would open and I didn't want to risk getting them into an unlocked condition. The Controller gave me short vectors to about a 6 mile final. I put both autopilots on; selected med auto brakes and we couldn't get the ACARS to provide landing numbers so I flew hook plus 10. 5 for ice and 5 for gusty winds. Somewhere around 500 ft. we saw the runway. I allowed the autopilot to get us to 200 ft. and turned them off. I didn't know how it would perform in those conditions The landing was uneventful and I sent the CFR guys home. We then were told we could not park back at our gate and had to wait a few hours for them to plow remote parking for us. Once in remote parking we waited for stairs and a ground crew. Shut down. Called Company. Plan was for us to try again as we had 2 hours duty left. After what we just went through I determined that to be unsafe and said no. They coded us as Fatigued and called the hotel. We had to wait for an hour or so for ground transport due to the bad road conditions. Got to the hotel at XK30 am with a plan of leaving out again at around XD00 pm. I got in bed at XM00 am and fell asleep. At XQ37 the phone in my room rang. It was the front desk saying to call Scheduling. I called them and was informed that we now had a much earlier departure. XU00pm van. I told him he disturbed my rest; I've only been sleeping for 4.5 hours after a long stressful duty day. The tone in the Schedulers voice changed and I could feel the pressure amping up. I asked if my FO (First Officer) had also been called and he said yes and he was ok to fly. I told him I'd call the FO and ask him myself. My FO said he was ok so we agreed to have a XU00pm van and try to get out of there again. We figured we'd show up; step on the jet and fly home. Arriving at the gateway we took them by total surprise. There was only a few office staff there. Told us it would be hours before workers showed up. I decided to use that time to get with Dispatch as the jet would be flown to ZZZ1 gear down. That was an extensive flight planning session and it was determined that we could only weigh 262000 in flight in case I lost an engine and needed to stay above the clouds as you can't fly in icing conditions with the gear down and there were clouds enroute with tops to 10000 ft. We also had to multiply our fuel burn by 2.2 per the charts. In order to do that the 60k of cargo would have to be unloaded. There was nobody to do that. At that point I was so tired I was struggling with even simple tasks and decided the mission was too complex and would take too long for my crew to safely fly. I informed the dispatcher; and 2 [other pilots] that we were too tired to fly and they all agreed we were not rested enough for the flight. We were again coded as fatigued and sent back to crew rest. During that rest we went from laying over for 24 Plus hours to being jump seated home the next morning.
Human Factors,We were inbound to ZZZ with MEL27-XX-X-X-X (Manual Spoilers-No Auto Spoilers). During the cruise phase of flight; we were contacted by the Dispatch regarding ZZZ Runway XXR closure and their request to reopen the runway for us has been approved by the Tower since our MEL included landing distance penalties. This concern was also noted in the release. All phases of the flight were normal including the descent phase. After review of landing performance data and performance charts with ATIS reporting winds 220 at 20G30 with good visibility; runway dry; and with ramp 3 assignment; we decided on XXR and have briefed Visual XXR back up with an ILS and with Flaps 50. During the vector on to right base XXR; scratch pad message 'ILS UNTUNABLE' displayed. With the airport in sight; we were then cleared for a visual approach to XXR.As PF (Pilot Flying) with gusty crosswind and no runway alignment guidance my focus was mostly outside. Flaps 50 configuration and associated visual cues were also little different than what I was used to. 1000 ft. and 500 ft. gates were normal and stable however; approaching minimums with gusty wind conditions aural 'Glideslope' was heard twice as I have noticed PAPI was indicating slightly low as I was correcting with Pitch and Thrust. At this point I was going to call for a 'Go Around' but since I was on a visual approach with 'ILS untunable' and current pitch and power would allow a safe landing; I decided to continue with passing the threshold at 50 ft. followed by a normal landing with flaps 50 and MED auto brakes. After landing as we were vacating the runway my immediate thoughts were; 'Why didn't I go around when first 'Glideslope' was heard...' Why was I thinking momentary deviation was acceptable in gusty condition on a visual approach...' If I was conducting a full ILS approach; I would have definitely gone around... but why was I thinking it was OK on a visual... My recommendation When any approach changes from what was briefed or expected; we should take our time and reset the box and re-brief appropriately. Don't be rushed and accept just because you are familiar with the airport. Practice No fault Go-Around policy! When in doubt!
Aircraft,We were scheduled to Operate Aircraft X from ZZZZ to ZZZ on DATE. We showed at the gateway on time and it immediately started to heavily snow. The weather was calling for light snow and -3C. We blocked out on time after checking the airfield snow conditions and weather. We were informed of severe icing south of ZZZZ below 14;000 ft. Though we were north of those conditions we were also informed of less severe icing conditions in the local area. We pushed back and had directional control issues on the taxiways at ZZZZ. We coordinated for the clearing of the taxiways and returned back to the gateway. After closely monitoring weather; runway; taxiway conditions for approximately 3 hours with our Dispatcher and Assistant Chief Pilot we decided it was legal and safe to proceed to ZZZ. We then proceeded to deice (which took more than 1hr) and the departure runway while getting a last-minute update on the weather; winds; icing conditions and runway conditions. We also received a PIREP from an arriving aircraft. At this time the winds were picking up but we felt it was safe and concluded we were legal to depart. We departed from Runway XX and when we went to retract the gear it did not retract. We immediately tried the alternate system and then executed the checklist. The weather was solid all the way to FL250. Due to our weight and the gear stuck down we knew we could not get above that weather and our ceiling would have been around FL200. We were aware of the severe icing to the south of our location and did not want to get near those conditions with our gear down. We knew we would start to accumulate ice on our landing gear that was stuck down so we decided to [request priority handling] and to execute a quick return back to ZZZZ. We requested the priority handling; executed our ECAM and emergency checklist and then coordinated for short vectors to final to Runway XX at ZZZZ while conducting all checklist and runway landing conditions. We planned to do a CAT-2 ILS but ended up executing a CAT-1 procedure due to better ceilings; visibility and left crosswinds. The approach and landing were uneventful. We then spent approximately 1.5 hours coordinating with plows and ZZZZ Ground crews to park our aircraft at an alternate location.
Human Factors,We were dispatched with MEL XX-XX-1-1. This MEL has an associated note that requires the flight crew to maintain the fuel balanced within limits. As the fuel approached the 2;500 pound lateral imbalance limit; I proceeded to cross feed the gas. I decided to open the cross feed valves on tank 3 and tank 2 to have both engines 2 and 3 burn out of tank 3. This would have solved the problem. Unfortunately when I reached to open the cross feed valve for tank 2; I mistakenly selected the boost pump switch for tank 2. These switches are right next to each other. I caught my mistake right away and turned the boost pumps back on. This didn't prevent the engine from flaming out. I immediately went to the ENG 2 RPM LO checklist and restarted the engine. Engine 2 was only shutdown for approximately 30 seconds or so. To prevent this from happening to another crew faced with this MEL; fuel balancing guidance should be added to the non alert section of the QRH with the appropriate cautions.
Aircraft,ZZZ Maintenance reported the pin retention boss for pin for handle lever was broken off. I went to engineering and engineer Name directed that MEL XX-XX-XX-2 be used that GMM 03.05.01.01 was to be used to authorize use of .032 stainless safety wire as an alternate fastener. I have not heard of using safety wire as an alternate fastener to be standard industry practice and no boss to secure it to in addition. I relayed my concern for safety of the aircraft that inside of the dump chute exposed to outside atmospheric pressure and the exterior of the chute being exposed to differential pressure could collapse the duct and depressurize aircraft. Dispute resolution signed by the Company forcing me into this action.
Aircraft,After takeoff on initial climb number 1 engine exceeded EGT limits. Accomplished checklists; notified [Maintenance] and Dispatch and returned to ZZZ; accomplished an overweight landing.
Aircraft,We were in cruise flight from ZZZ - ZZZ1. We leveled off at FL340. Shortly after we leveled off we noticed the aircraft yawing a bit. I noticed the right thrust lever advancing and the left one staying in place but the N1 was slowly rolling back. I pushed the left thrust lever up but was unresponsive and the engine continued to roll back and eventually failed. We requested priority handling; ran the engine failure and drift down checklist so we can descend to FL240 which is the top of the relight envelope. While the aircraft was stabilized we attempted a cross bleed restart. Everything appeared to be normal but we never got it to restart. While doing this we determined our best course of action was to divert to ZZZZ. We knew another airline has support there. ACARS communication was very intermittent but we got messages through to Dispatch as to our plans. We continued on to a fix on the ILS XX approach into ZZZZ. Even though I was the Pilot Flying; the Captain had just completed recurrent training the week before so he decided he would perform the landing. I reviewed all the checklists and we continued. The approach was flown flap 15 single engine. We landed uneventfully and taxied off of the Runway to the Gate we were assigned. The Captain made appropriate phone calls to the Chief Pilot; Maintenance and Crew Desk. Overall I think everything was handled well by everyone involved.
Aircraft,Climbing thru FL130'; 'eng oil low pressure' was activated on the local alert; followed after a slight delay by 'eng oil low pressure ' on the CAP. The decision was made to shutdown and secure #1 engine according to checklists and company procedures. ATC was notified; and priority handling was requested. Returned to ZZZZ for landing Runway XX.
Aircraft,At Gate XX on Aircraft X after starting the APU and then turning on the APU Bleed a strong odor of smelly socks was noted in the cockpit. The APU Bleed was subsequently turned off and the odor subsided. Item was written up in the AML and ZZZ Maintenance was notified. This was a previous write [up] the day before on this aircraft. Contamination of aircraft bleed system.
Procedure,I was Captain operating Aircraft X on DATE. I arrived at the airport on the shuttle at approximately XA:20am local time. I proceeded immediately to the gate and found the FO (First Officer) already on board. We exchanged greetings and confirmed what we had said the previous day that the FO would act as Pilot Flying; PF to ZZZ and I would act as PF returning to ZZZ1. The FO then briefed me that they had completed the power up and receiving check lists. I then took the release and briefed inflight crew. Next; I entered the cockpit to retrieve a safety vest in order to perform the preflight inspection walk around. During the walk around; I found a greenish; somewhat foamy and oily appearing liquid dripping from the APU bay from the space between the two doors of the APU compartment. I further inspected to determine the fluid I noticed could not be from lavatory waste; water or drain masts. It was not from any of the other possibilities and the unknown fluid had formed a puddle of approximate dimensions of a circle of 2-3 ft. in diameter. I then completed the walk around inspection; looked for a member of Maintenance team outside and found no one; then re-entered the aircraft cockpit. I requested the FO call operations and request a Maintenance member to come to the aircraft. The FO said OK and good as we also had a fault that needed Maintenance to clear. In just a short time; Maintenance Lead; came to the cockpit and I told him of both issues. He performed a reset of the fault and said he would go outside to visually inspect the fluid leak. Maintenance Lead returned and told us that the leaking fluid was only type 4 de ice fluid. I questioned that since we do not deice in ZZZ1 if he was certain. Maintenance Lead said that it was not unusual for deice fluid to take a long time to exit the aircraft; but he was certain. I had not made entry in the logbook as no corrective action was required. We finished our duties and departed ZZZ1 for ZZZ. The flight was uneventful; and we landed and taxied to the gate. The preflight walk around for Aircraft X was completed by the FO who stated as soon as they returned that there did not appear to be anything leaking from the APU area. I thanked her and we continued to perform all preflight duties according to SOP. Part of these duties include checking Hydraulic fluid quantities are in the acceptable range; they were. The flight blocked out at XI51 UTC and all duties and responsibilities were performed in accordance with all regulation and SOP. Takeoff and climb were uneventful and the aircraft was cleared to ZZZZZ intersection and to climb unrestricted to flight level 340.At approximately XJ32 UTC; we were presented with a level 2 caution message HYD G RSVR LO LVL. I first stated; 'I am pilot flying.' Then directed for the FO to check there was no QRC including bypass item. She did and stated nothing was found. At that point I told the FO that I have had this very same hydraulic issue in a 'Classic' A320 previously. I added that I could see no reason at this point to [request priority handling] as we did not need priority handling as yet. I further stated at this time that our intent was to continue to destination. The FO said she understood; and I then turned the flying over to her with the statement; 'you have control'. She responded with 'I have control ECAM actions'. I performed the ECAM and reviewed the QRH for the fault. We then discussed how we wanted to make notifications to Inflight; ATC and the company. After good discussions between the FO and myself; we made the decision to tell Inflight via briefing the number one flight attendant face-to-face and they could then tell their crew. Secondly; we would inform the company via ACARS as they needed time to arrange a ground crew to move the aircraft from the runway. We decided that we would let ZZZ1 Approach ATC know when we were directed to speak to them and at that time; we would [request priority handling]. We brought the number one flight attendant into the cockpit to brief them; we also told the number one flight attendant that this would be a [priority landing]; and they asked several great questions regarding the loss of the Green hydraulic system. When all their questions were answered; the flight crew took a restroom break and the number one flight attendant returned to the cabin. I then sent an ACARS message to Operations Control that told them of the problem and our intent to land in ZZZ1. Very soon after I answered a SATCOM call from Operations Control to review the message and see if we wanted assistance from Maintenance Control. I stated they should let us know if there was anything of importance to add; but I have personally been through this same fault previously and I was not concerned. I did discuss at great length with the FO that when I had personally been through this previously; that the hydraulic fluid had drained from a broken fitting in the number one pylon into the number one engine creating a great deal of smoke. I emphasized that my experience was to remain open throughout the conduct of the non-normal situation to expect something unplanned to occur and that we would handle whatever else came up with the same professional adherence to SOP we had with the fault we were given. I went on to tell the FO that I wanted every bit of information they might have to add to the successful outcome; and nothing was to be left unsaid. I told the FO 'I want to hear the craziest thing you have ever said; which is to say; I do not want you to hesitate to say anything and I value anything you have to say'. We were cleared to descend using the ZZZZZ1 XX RNAV ARRIVAL to ZZZ1 and plan landing south. The arrival and approaches were briefed. On first contact with ZZZ1 Approach the FO also then [requested priority handling]. There was brief discussion on the nature of the emergency and what services we required. The FO passed along that we would require a slightly longer than normal downwind leg to facilitate deploying the gear via emergency procedures and that we would request CFR meet the aircraft after we stopped for a visual inspection; as we had previously discussed. ATC confirmed that this was acceptable; and we performed the longer downwind. The FO deployed the landing gear via the alternate procedure; and we requested to turn in for the visual landing. At approximately 1;000 ft. from landing; the flight attendants called to say that passengers were concerned with a smell of burning hydraulic fluid. I knew there was no time to do anything with that; so I performed the landing as we had briefed to a full stop and CFR conducted a visual and infrared inspection to declare all clear. We then started the APU and when the start was complete; shut down both engines using the SOP for after landing and parking. We did have to customize both checklists as some items could not be completed until we were at the gate and even then; the emergency gear extension handle was required to remain out and not stowed.The aircraft was towed by [Ramp] Personnel to Gate XX in ZZZ1 and the passengers were deplaned. The FO called to confirm our gate assignment and operations asked if we had [requested priority handling with] inflight. I asked the FO to not answer that request as we were still not complete with the flight. All possible checklists and procedures were complied with prior to leaving the aircraft once we were at the gate. The parking checklist was completed except for the emergency gear handle and deplaning was begun. Then someone from Operations knocked on the door and asked to speak to me to ask if I declared a situation to inflight. I asked if we could speak later. I spoke to all Inflight crew to thank them for their professionalism and dedication to customer safety. I reiterated the same to the two members of Inflight management who were now on board. I then called for Maintenance to come to the aircraft for a debriefing. The reply to this request wasto ask if I had declared a situation to inflight; as I knew that this was an open frequency and that it was available for anyone to be listening; I did not answer. I asked again for Tech Ops to meet me at the aircraft. At this time the FO was ready to depart; and I took a moment to sincerely thank them for being such a great professional and told them how I genuinely appreciated them for making my job so much easier. We shook hands and briefly embraced and said goodbye.NAME1 from Maintenance was on board; and I briefed him on everything and asked him if he needed more than my short logbook entry that we experienced HYD G RSVR LO LVL in flight. He replied no and I handed over the aircraft to him. When I arrived in the gate area; the gate agents said I was supposed to wait and speak to Operations on the phone. The Gate Agent dialed the phone and the Operations person asked me if I had declared a situation to inflight. I replied that I was unsure of answering any questions at that time and would be filing all required reports. I then departed the airport and went home.Thoughts: I would like to know where the hydraulic leak occurred.Crew members need to not give out operational information; or ask questions regarding operational issues of emergency or non-normal situations over open radio frequencies.
Aircraft,Flight Crew experienced two fume events on subsequent days while operating the same aircraft.   The first event occurred during taxi out when the aircraft and crew experienced a lengthy ground delay for hazardous weather in the terminal area and subsequent gate return to add additional fuel to operate the flight on an alternate route to the destination.The ground delay before the aircraft was able to return to the gate took over 2.5 hours from original pushback from the gate. The aircraft operated on one engine and the APU for more than half of the time period. Once the aircraft was assigned a return gate to was safely able to taxi to it; the Captain directed the #2 engine to be restarted; in order to more safely taxi the aircraft in the confined apron area adjacent to the gate (Gate XXX).  It was during this restart of the engine that the aircraft cabin experienced visible misting and fumes; which was reported to the cabin by the Lead Flight Attendant. Shortly following this call; the flightdeck also experienced fume odors as well (no misting).  Flight crew performed fume isolation procedures ans use of supplemental oxygen to mitigate the impact of the fumes in both the cabin and flightdeck.  APU was shutdown as part of the isolation procedure.After returning to the gate; the Flight Crew was released from duty and went into crew rest. The Flight Crew was subsequently reassigned to operate the same flight on delayed departure status the next afternoon; using the same aircraft from the night prior.The aircraft was inspected by Tech Operations and the APU was not available for the later flight under an MEL status.  The Flight Crew performed an alternate engine start of the #2 engine at the gate; using an external HP air cart. However; shortly after the engine was started and the aircraft was being pushed back; the Flight Crew and in-flight crew noticed fume odors in both the flightdeck and cabin.The Captain determined that the flight needed to immediately return to the gate on one engine; in order to shut down the fume source and remove the crew and passengers from the aircraft as soon as possible. The effects of the fumes in the flightdeck nearly incapacitated the First Officer from being able to talk due to profuse reactionary coughing from the fumes.
Aircraft,ZZZ1 to ZZZ. Three hours into the flight we descended from FL360 to 10;000 ft. for the arrival into ZZZ. After level off we detected a slight odor in the cockpit. As we continued the descent to 6;000 ft. the odor became more intense. All of the inflight confirmed the smell and characterized it as burning alcohol/oil in the aft galley. We realized the aircraft was having another fumes event and expedited the landing. Pack one was turned off after landing since that appeared to work for previous crew who had also had a fumes event in this aircraft. Unfortunately; after exposure to the fumes one becomes numb to the odor and it is difficult to determine if any action corrected the situation. At the Gate the next crew boarded the aircraft and confirmed the fumes were still present.
Company Policy,"There is a NOTAM; FDC X/XXXX; of which has caused confusion among flight crewmembers I have flown with. It states to select the RNAV X when cleared for the ZZZ1 Visual XX. However; our XX-X approach plate for the ZZZ1 visual state ; 'Company Procedure: When cleared for the ZZZ Visual XX; crews should select RNAV-V in the FMS for lateral and vertical guidance. APP mode may be used to provide LNAV and GP guidance. RNAV-X XX is also available if unable to fly RF (Radius to Fix) legs.' The alert XX-X-X page states; Based on crew feedback the following steps should be used when flying the RNAV GPS-X XX..."" It never even mentions the RNAV-V approach. We elected to fly the RNAV X due to the NOTAM and the fact that 5G NOTAMs are in effect at ZZZ on Runway XX. However; after discussing this with various pilots and a FAA observer who was in my jumpseat today; I was asked to report this due to its conflicting information.Update the XX-X ZZZ1 visual approach plate to state to fly the RNAV-X so that all information is standard. The RNAV-V should be removed from the FMS and approach plate terminology until the approach becomes valid again. The NOTAM is in effect until Date."""
Aircraft,Prior to closing the Main Cabin Door; Captain came out of the Cockpit and instructed me to have the passengers to rapidly deplane the aircraft because there was fire/smoke in the Cockpit. Brake had not been dropped; Jetway still attached; Main Cabin Door was still open. There were no passengers injuries.
Weather,I landed on Runway 3. The surface was black ice with braking action nil. I departed the runway off the right edge. The airplane came to an immediate stop upon contact with snowy terrain. Actions prior to the incident including checking NOTAMs for anything regarding runway conditions and texting the Airport Manager for field conditions. There were no NOTAMS and the Airport Manager did not reply. I looked over the runway and saw no snow on the surface and could see all of the black color of the asphalt. I landed normally. The aircraft began slowing with brake application but when I got down to about 10 to 20 kts. I began sliding until the plane came to a stop.The airplane was not damaged and was easily recovered from the grass. After inspection; it was returned to service.What could have prevented this would be a proactive approach to reporting runway conditions. The airport operator could have posted a NOTAM about poor to nil braking action. He observed wet runways at close of business the day before and the temperature was forecasted to be well below freezing.  A NOTAM would have been good; or an advisory when contacted directly would been useful. Armed with better information; I could have diverted to an alternate.
Aircraft,After leveling at 32000 ft. Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) indicated: 'Hyd Press PrI R' and 'Hyd Qy Low R'. We completed the appropriate checklists and called Dispatch on the SAT phone. We conferenced in Maintenance to discuss our situation. As a crew we decided the safest course of action was to request priority handling; dump fuel to ZZZ; and return to ZZZZ. We dumped approximately 136;000 lbs. of fuel over water with ATC clearance and then we proceeded direct to ZZZZ for an ILSXX. We requested Fire Rescue as a precaution and landed uneventfully. Taxied to Gate X with AFR escort. We blocked in; sent Maintenance discrepancies and then met with Maintenance personnel to discuss event. They found Crack in pump housing to be cause of fluid loss.
Weather,Climbing out of ZZZ the First Officer was getting saturated with radio calls and heading and altitude instructions. I decided to turn on the autopilot to help him out. As I turned on the autopilot; we hit turbulence and received a 'bank angle ' alert. I disconnected the autopilot and regained control of the airplane and turned the autopilot on again.
Aircraft,The First Officer (FO) and I met in the cockpit and went through the pre-flight set up. We completed our flows as per [the airline]. The First Officer went outside to do the pre-flight inspection and I finished the cockpit set up for take off. I had brought a sandwich on board and went to take a bite when I heard a loud 'Pop'; followed by a 'Wooosh' sound. Seconds later there was a very acrid smell and smoke. The [Lead Flight Attendant] yelled in shortly later about the smell and smoke. I then told her we had a problem and for her and the other FAs (Flight Attendant) to grab their stuff and get out. Once learning we had customers on the jet bridge I asked the [Lead Flight Attendant] to please get the customers back up to the terminal. I was able to call ZZZ Maintenance and say we have smoke in the cockpit and I am shutting down all power to the airplane. I turned off the EXT power; BATT switches and activated the fire switch to the APU for an immediate shut down. I met with the Flight Attendants (FA) again once their Supervisors showed up to lend support. Two of them later became ill feeling from the smoke. After meeting with probably 12 Tech Operations people; we went up to the gate and I gave a PA announcement to the passengers.
Human Factors,We landed on Runway XX ZZZZ. As soon as we started to turn around for the back taxi; we heard tower communicate to the first of two Caravans on short final to prepare for a go-around. The response from the Caravan was 'Plenty of time'. Both my First Officer and I were unsettled to say the least as we turned the aircraft around and went head to head with the landing aircraft. I expedited towards Taxiway 1 but ATC correctly decided this was getting too close and told the Caravan to 'go-around.' The Caravan responded 'Still plenty of time.' and continued his approach. ATC instructed him a second time to 'go-around' and after a long silence the Caravan responded 'we still have time'. It was at this moment that I became concerned for our safety. The Caravan was on about 1/2 mile final 300 feet above the Runway as I stated to turn onto taxiway 1. I quickly exited the runway as ATC strongly commanded the Caravan to 'go-around' for the third time and the Caravan complied.
Aircraft,Descending through approximately FL300 ECAM alerted us to a low quantity in the green hydraulic system. After confirming the low quantity on the overhead panel; we shut off the engine driven green hydraulic pumps. We followed the QRH procedures which had us turn off some spoilers; calculate new landing distance/speeds and gravity extend the landing gear. We [requested priority handling] and requested the longest Runway at ZZZ. After the plane was fully configured with gear down and flaps 40; I scanned the overhead panel and saw the green hydraulic quantity was normal. Landing was uneventful and we were towed to the Gate.
Aircraft,Upon descending in ZZZ; I smelled the dirty sock; locker room smell and was asked by the Captain; after landing if I had smelled anything during the flight and I had. Whatever corrective measures that should or could be done to these issues!
Human Factors,Being vectored onto a downwind for a visual to [Runway] XXR; I noticed TCAS traffic pop up ahead on the display. Immediately after that ATC instructed us to climb to 5;000 to avoid the unknown traffic. I could see the traffic at this point. The automation was slow to climb; so I disconnected the autopilot to help expedite.  ATC then instructed us to turn left to 140 for traffic avoidance. Just as I started the turn--or continued it; really--we got an aural traffic alert followed immediately by an RA. All of this happened very quickly. The RA commanded a descent; which was unexpected. But the FO noticed immediately and verbalized it. I disconnected the auto throttle and pushed the nose down; but overcoming the climb momentum was difficult and took a lot of effort. The traffic passed in front of us and to our right; quite closely; apparently climbing. ATC was advised we were complying with an RA. On the 140 heading at about 3;700 feet we were clear of the conflict and ATC had us maintain 4;000 and turn back to 170. The controller informed us the conflict aircraft had entered Class B without clearance and was being tracked. We continued vectors for a visual to XXR and landed normally with no further incident. I believe the vector to 140 ATC gave us made the difference.Cause - Aircraft entering ZZZ Class B airspace without clearance.At the time we were in Class B airspace and slowing to configure at this point was not necessary; but had I been at a slower speed we would have had more time; although we were converging. Also; I turned the autopilot off and pushed the thrust manually because I sensed we were going to have to maneuver; but we were not technically in an RA. I should have turned the auto throttle off then also; which would have helped some in the reversal from climb to descent; maybe.
Ambiguous,I was asked to voluntarily submit a report with details for safety purposes; no proposed violation was involved.  I've been flying for XX+ years with YY years active and reserve instructing/evaluating in military trainers.  I'm somewhat of an expert at judging these distances and speeds.  I changed the altitude in the FMS (earlier) at ZZZZZ to a hard 10;000 MSL from a range of 10;000-11;000 MSL as is typical for me.  I was clearing both outside and inside to the PFD/ND to ensure compliance at ZZZZZ.  At ZZZZZ +/- 0.5 miles (most likely at; or after); I noticed a red and white aircraft approximately 800 ft ahead; centered vertically in the Captains windscreen and 2/3 of the way across his windscreen towards the center divider.  I was at a right 8-9 aspect angle (based on his aircraft) with an approximate 70 left heading crossing angle.  His aircraft had near zero motion in the windscreen.  In short I was flying up his 3-9 line; co-altitude with a 416 ft per second closure rate.  Slightly faster if one considers TAS.  Subtract from that closure rate the velocity they had in the same direction (near zero).  I instinctively knew I would collide if I tried to turn right; or left.  I most likely would have collided if I tried to climb over; but certainly would have sent him into an unusual attitude due to my wake/thrust turbulence.  My only choice was to click off the autopilot; rip the throttles to idle and bunt under.  I used enough force to miss the target; but with the secondary consideration of flight attendant and passenger safety.  I would estimate this was a negative 0.25 to positive 0.25 G pushover.  As I passed directly underneath; I became a little concerned that my tail might hit the aircraft.  In short I had 2 to no more than 3 seconds to identify the threat and react appropriately.  I could easily read the tail number across his fuselage; but wasn't concerned with that.  At no time was there and RA; TA; or Proximity displayed on the TCAS.  They apparently either didn't have the transponder; or have it turned on.  ATCC did not have any reading; or skin paint of their aircraft on radar; so no warning was issued.Considering the size of the other aircraft; closure rate; and being nearly motionless in the windscreen; there was little room for any improved clearing technique on my behalf.  A TCAS reading would have avoided the whole scenario.Suggest - Require transponder usage for all aircraft near Class B airspace; or their associated STARS and Departures.
Airport,Aircraft taxied beyond hold short point. Received taxi clearance to taxi to Runway 4R BOS. Clearance was taxi to [Runway] 4R via [Taxiways] E1; K; B; hold short of Juliet. Give way to [Aircraft Z] from your right. I read back clearance correctly; wrote it down; then read it again to the CA (Captain). I cleared him right after the [Aircraft Z] passed for his right onto [Taxiway] E1. I informed Ground we were awaiting numbers. Close out printed after turning onto [Taxiway] K and I informed Ground we had our numbers. I told CA I was heads down and entered numbers and briefed closeout. We checked flight controls on [Taxiway] K. I cleared him right onto [Taxiway] B and went heads down to complete the before take off flow and checklist. When I announced 'to the line' and performed that flow he said continue. We performed checklist below the line and announced before takeoff checklist complete. I heard [a] radio call [for us to] hold position. I responded to Tower and I looked up to see we were in the bend of Taxiway B and I asked CA if he had passed [Taxiway] Juliet. He said yes; and realized we'd gone past the hold short at [Taxiway] Juliet. [Aircraft Y] was told to go around and we were then cleared across [Runway] 4L and cleared for takeoff without further incident. The CA copied the taxi clearance that I repeated; but failed to write down the hold short of [Taxiway] Juliet instructions. We originally thought we would get [Runway] 33L due to performance and briefed that taxi on the departure briefing. We received [Runway] 4R as our runway with our push clearance. It was not on the ATIS for a departure runway. The taxi to [Runway] 4R was briefed but was a short taxi requiring a lot of heads down time for the FO (First Officer) due to delayed closeout numbers. I was not familiar with Boston having only been there a couple of times and did not know of the Non-standard position of the [Runway] 4L holdshort on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet. There was a lot of aircraft taxiing in both directions adding another distraction. Taxiway Bravo does not cross the inner Runway 4L giving the impression one would not need to stop until reaching the hold short for [Runway] 4R. There are no hold bars or lights at [Taxiway] Juliet. [Suggest] Hold lights at the hold short on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet when there is landing traffic on [Runway] 4L. Tower call for aircraft to hold short of [Runway] 4L on [Taxiway] Bravo at [Taxiway] Juliet for landing traffic after the handoff to them from ground on [Taxiway] Kilo.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,Lack of approach radar service creates unnecessary hazard at MBPV airport. Now functioning beyond burst traffic capacity; this single runway; no-parallel taxiway remote airfield with 4 FBOs and Air Carrier Operations cannot continue to expect safe results by the badly over-burdened ATC personnel. Constant radio calls asking numerous aircraft for multiple position reports and passing altitudes on arrival leaves no margin for routine or urgent communications. The Air Traffic Controller's inability to obtain approach; landing; departure sequence awareness due to a lack of available technology; places flight operations at serious risk of safety. No errors or deviations were made during our flight and the Air Traffic Controllers performed their work to the best of their ability. This is an attempt to bring awareness to the traffic situation and the need to improve ATC infrastructure capability at MBVP airport. The high level of 'new-to-ICAO' pilots operating in the area further complicate matters by requiring repeated radio calls in this non-radar environment. We observed the ATC individual personnel being over- tasked with managing Clearance; Ground; Tower; [and] Approach frequencies simultaneously. This workload could not safely continue in marginal weather or aircraft contingency operations. Please bring a technological upgrade (radar or other operating picture platform) to Approach and Tower operations at MBPV airport to reduce continuous radio traffic and Controller workload.
Human Factors,We pushed back from Gate XX; when we stopped momentarily before being pulled forward he said 'clear to start' (we started the engines while being pulled forward) then he pulled us forward to abeam Gate XX and we stopped. I had my right hand on the parking brake and my left hand on the push to talk on the side stick like I always do anticipating the ground crew to tell me to set the brakes. The next thing I felt was the tow bar being disconnected and I looked down to the signal man and he was signaling to me to set the brakes and that's when I felt the aircraft starting to roll. I set the brakes and we stopped after rolling approximately 2 ft. At that point I flashed the nose light a few times to get their attention because I wanted them back on inter phone. The signal man and gear pin man we're trying to get a salute out of me and I kept requesting that they plug back in with my hands on my ears. They finally plugged back in and I asked them if everyone was ok. I said; you never told me to set the brakes and He said yes I did and you (meaning me) told him to disconnect the inter phone which was a complete lie because the First Officer and I looked at each other and said to each other that I never said a word. I would never set the brakes until they told me because sometimes they pull you forward. And then while I was taxiing out for take off; I got a message from Dispatch not to take off and I need to call the Duty Chief. I called Dispatch and he patched me to the duty chief and he asked me if I was feeling OK. Suggestion - Create a double read back with ground crew
Human Factors,While proceeding northwest on a VFR flight from ZZZZ to ZZZZ1 we began our descent into ZZZZ1. I was Pilot Monitoring in the right seat and my Captain was Pilot Flying in the left seat. While descending through roughly 3;000 to 5000 ft. Approach notified us of IFR traffic; 8-10 miles away departing ZZZZ1 that were proceeding southbound and climbing. We did not have the traffic in sight and advised that we were looking. My Captain and I identified the target on the map page of the GPS and could see that we were on a collision course but had plenty of time to take action so we continued our descent. Shortly after we stated that we did not have them in sight; Approach gave them a left turn to 270 from their initial southerly heading and repeated it to clarify that they needed a wide left turn due to traffic. We heard the other aircraft acknowledge the instructions correctly and believed that the initial collision hazard had been mitigated. While continuing to monitor the target on the map page of the GPS; my Captain and I noticed that the aircraft's course had not changed and we were now about 5 miles apart and on a collision course. The other aircraft was still climbing southbound and we were still descending north-west bound with somewhere around 1500 ft. of separation. My Captain suggested a turn about 20 degrees left to add separation for when they began their left turn and I agreed that that was a smart decision.While executing the left turn; Approach advised the other aircraft that they needed an immediate left turn to heading 270 for traffic. We heard no response from the other aircraft. At this moment we were about 2 to 3 miles apart; still on a collision course and likely closing in on each other somewhere around 350 kts. The GPS had begun to alert us about a traffic hazard and we still did not have visual contact with the target due to the scattered cloud layer ahead. With their lack of complicity; I suggested that we turn right immediately to the north/northeast to avoid crossing through their southerly course. My Captain agreed that that was a good idea and they disconnected the auto pilot and immediately began a turn to the right to avoid the other aircraft's southerly course. As we started to turn away from their southerly course the other aircraft began the left turn that they did not acknowledge or initially comply with. We had no way of knowing this because we couldn't locate the other aircraft visually and the traffic warning was not accurate enough to depict immediate turns from other aircraft. It wasn't until we were about a 45 degree bank to the right that my Captain told me that they saw the other aircraft pass underneath our left wing by roughly 500 ft. At no point in time did I ever see the other aircraft due to their position and visibility restrictions low and left from the right seat. Almost immediately after or before the aircraft passed underneath our wing; I don't remember the exact timing; but the other aircraft stated hesitantly that they thought they were on a 180 heading. Approach corrected them and reminded them that they said 'left turn heading 270' multiple times. Following the near miss; the flight continued uneventfully and the passengers did not seem concerned or aware of what happened while deplaning.Thinking back the best suggestion to have avoided this would've been to level off and stop our decent sooner or alter course sooner. However in the moment by the time realized they were not complying we were close and somewhere around 1500 ft. apart. Slowing down and picking the nose up could've been the difference between spotting them and having an aircraft climb into us right in our blind spot especially if they were climbing at or near their best rate. Altering course more aggressively earlier also would have helped but after hearing them correctly acknowledge instructions our initial deviation to the left felt like a smart choice with safe margins in the moment. Operationally; we tryto remain efficient and safe so based on what we first knew; turning very far to the left would have put us very far west and likely could have put us outside of glide so it was an impractical choice assuming they did as they acknowledged.
Aircraft,I was working the number 3 position & after takeoff; once I heard the chime indicating the end of Sterile Flight deck I got up and began heading towards the Back Galley for service. Once I began approaching seats 22+ heading aft of the Aircraft; I started smelling a burning smell. I didn't think much of it however as I made it to the back jumpseat it began smelling more like burning oil or something like that. NAME 1; our #4 came to the back galley as well & immediately said he smelled fumes as well. NAME 2 also smelled it. As NAME 1 called the Captain; I swiftly made my way upfront to let our #1 NAME 3 know what was going on as well. The smell wasn't upfront from what I could smell. She headed towards the back and instructed me to turn the lights to bright which I did and then I followed her towards the back. This time; as I made my way to towards the back of the Cabin & to the back Galley; I still smelled the fumes however; it smelled much less significant as if it was fast dissipating. Shortly thereafter; the Captain made an announcement acknowledging his awareness of the smell & giving assurance that everything was okay & that it would clear up soon & we'd be continuing our flight to ZZZ with no interruptions. The smell did go away & there wasn't any other indications of it throughout the rest of our flight.
Procedure,I was the Controller providing service. Aircraft X; was attempting to land Runway XXR. We had high cross winds (gusting 25 kts.) today with multiple go-arounds before this one. Aircraft X was over the Runway very low and encountered a gain of 15 kts. They went around on their own and my instruction to them was 'execute published missed'. I did the standard go-around coordination with TRACON then gave the pilot a frequency change. I noticed out the window how quickly the pilot turned for ZZZ1 and commented to the Tower Cab.The problem with the event was Aircraft X was on a visual approach when I thought he was on an ILS approach. We just changed our procedure with TRACON from issuing ALL go-arounds 'Runway heading at 10000' to issuing on visual approach 'Runway heading at 10000' and ILS approach 'Execute missed approach'. When I instructed the Pilot to 'Execute missed approach' he confidently said 'Roger' which further convinced me he was on an ILS approach because he spoke like he was familiar with the go-around procedure he was about to complete.Before we changed this LOA with TRACON I had zero go-around errors for over 4 years at ZZZ. I personally like the simplicity of giving all go-arounds 'Runway heading at 10000' and do not see the advantage of this change. I observed the Pilot overcome a very critical phase of flight and begin their go-around and did not want to add to their work load by verifying which approach procedure they were on. I understand this should have been verified while the plane was on approach but in the event that Controller misses it; or the data tag is inaccurate; it shouldn't immediately lead to a loss of MVA separation.I recommend changing the LOA with TRACON back to issuing all IFR go-arounds 'Runway heading at 10000.'
Aircraft,As I recall: At approximately FL250 climbing to FL290 the First Officer (FO) asked if I smelled exhaust. I said I didn't. We leveled FL290; initial cruise altitude. She said she felt lightheaded and was going to take some oxygen from the mask. I think that was for roughly 2 to 3 minutes. I still didn't smell anything. When she returned; she requested that we land. I was surprised; but certainly understood if she felt that way that we would land. Coordinated with Dispatch to determine where they would prefer that we go. Their choice was ZZZ. By the time we turned around; ran checklists; coordinated with ATC; Company; briefed FAs (Flight Attendants); passengers; I figured we'd be landing at ZZZ (landing as soon as possible). That choice made sense. ATC handled everything professionally and were very accommodating to our requests. Dispatch was great; helpful... provided the landing data for numerous different runways. He also indicated that [priority handling] must be declared due to the overweight landing. When safe on deck; the Chief Pilot informed me that that was incorrect (for future knowledge). I wasn't 100% sure at the time; just thought; no harm no foul; [requested priority handling] and continued with the plan. At one point I called; informed our Flight Manager of the situation. I asked her if she smelled exhaust fumes in the cabin. She said she didn't. We asked her to come up to the cockpit to see if she smelled fumes up front... She said she did. She then returned to the cabin; I called her a few minutes later; she said she still couldn't smell exhaust in the cabin. I never smelled; felt or saw anything; but the FO did; and that's the point. The FO managed to continue her duties; even though she wasn't feeling well. She did a great job. We continued. Reviewed Smoke; Fumes checklist; Overweight Landing checklist; requested to land west instead of east as ATIS was advertising. Approved as requested. We transferred the controls and I landed the aircraft; 25R. Uneventful. Opted to taxi to the gate; Crash Fire Rescue trucks followed us in. They checked the brakes; were ready to help anyone if required. To my knowledge; no passengers reported smelling fumes; the lead FA confirmed that. Once shut down; customer service came aboard; as did Maintenance. We called Dispatch; the Chief Pilot and [I] called it a night. It won't surprise me if Maintenance finds something. I fully trust that the FO (and the lead FA) smelled something; it was most definitely making the FO nauseous. We needed to land.
Ambiguous,On my flight the ground crew obviously had a poor understanding of English language. The ground crew tried their best but they have a week understanding of our ground handling procedures complicated by weak knowledge of the English language. These two problems combine to make for an incredibly dangerous situation! I was unable to comply with ground controls push instructions because I had doubt that the ground handler understood the instructions therefore I elected to hold the push until I was assured no other aircraft were close by. Ground crew did not follow SOP for push at all. They were very nice folks but they desperately need training to avoid a ground mishap.
Aircraft,After engine start and starting to taxi; noticed an odor. Called flight attendants that confirmed odor throughout the cabin; returned to gate.
Ambiguous,We were on the Espo Arrval; and on the downwind leg we heard a heavy being vectored on to the 10C ILS PRM approach. When we turned base we asked if we were going to be following the heavy; and was told we were not. After another transmission from Approach to another aircraft he came back and said that we would be following a heavy. We were given a slightly late (it seemed) vector on to final to intercept. We went through final a little bit as we had a tailwind. I asked approach if we could slow a little more because of following the heavy with a quartering tailwind but was told he knew about the wind and wanted the speed.As we were trying to capture the localizer the autopilot struggled with capturing it and began to bank excessively in both directions to capture it. At this point we began to hand fly and decided to discontinue the approach as it was in the best interest of safety to not continue as we were not stable and I did not foresee us being able to continue in a safe and stabilized manner. We were told to track the localizer outbound and the plane struggled with that in autopilot as well. Before we began to once again go to hand flying we were given a heading.We were given vectors to ILS PRM 10R for another attempt. When we were vectored on the approach the autopilot did struggle to capture the approach; but shortly after being vectored on we lost the localizer on both sides. At this point we were vectored off and we let ATC or approach; I don't remember who we were talking to; know that we lost the localizer. We were given the GPS to Runway 9L. We flew that approach and continued without any further problems.The primary cause of this was automation problems with the localizer/autopilot; however the autopilot only struggled in Green Needles with the Localizer; and in no other modes. A possible contributing factor was wake encounter with preceding heavy with quartering tailwind. I do not know for certain this was the case; as there was no violent upset; however while we had problems capturing both localizers; the autopilot only banked excessively when we followed the heavy; almost as if we were in wake.Maintenance required for the navigation radios would be a primary fix as this seemed to be a problem with the systems. However; as wake turbulence was a possible or plausible contributing factor; I think it would be important to mention that is seems that lack of concern of wake turbulence and the associated hazards is becoming a common issue I have noticed. In addition to this it seems that there is a lack of understanding on the part of FAA Facilities how wind and altitude will affect wake. Better understanding as well as better cooperation and coordination with air crews on the part of controllers would lead to a safer working environment.
Human Factors,I dispatched a flight to an airport that does not have a 5G AMOC for the Aircraft X aircraft type. The flight's dispatch release was initially planned legal at first but the TAF updated before the aircraft reached point of dispatch and I forgot about the flight and the flight took off with 1/4 SM in the new TAF and therefore was an illegal dispatch. At the last second; I remembered about the flight and I sent frantic ACARS messages and tried to call ATC but it was too late the flight was on the takeoff roll when I tried to call ATC and they took off. The Flight landed at intended destination with no further issues after taking off illegally. I was very task saturated today with weather issues and it caused me to get behind. In my opinion; I was more behind today than I normally am because of weather and maintenance issues.  I had 2 Aircraft X flights that were departing the same location to the destination that has no 5G AMOC. When the TAF updated and had 1/4 SM now in the TAF for ETA; I reached out to one of of the flights and made sure they did not pushback from the gate. Because I was task saturated and behind; I got tunnel focused and forgot about the other Aircraft X flight at that same airport going to the same destination. By the time I realized I did not tell that other flight to stop too; it was exactly 10 minutes after ACARS OUT time was recorded. I frantically sent ACARS messages to get them not to takeoff and to call me and as well I tried to call ATC multiple times but for some reason Tower would not answer the phone. Unfortunately the flight took off with two alternates on the release but the flight did not qualify for Exemption because there was no conditional language in the TAF at ETA and as well the main body at ETA read '1/4 SM'. For this reason; it was an illegal dispatch. For the record; at time of planning; the ETA showed 1/2 SM in the TAF at ETA and the flight was planned with 2 alternates in case a new TAF came out with conditional language so that Exemption could be used if need be. I will do a better time of issuing flight crews pertinent safety of flight information such as weather per my sole responsibilities in the role of Aircraft Dispatcher. I will do a better time of increasing situational awareness and keep a better track of my flights to ensure safety of flight is never compromised. I will do a better time of duty/task prioritization and ensure that this issue does not occur again.
Ambiguous,We were cleared to HEAPP intersection; cleared ILS 4. I was waiting for the ghost needles to appear on the PFD's to indicate the approach course for the ILS. It never did so I selected HDG mode; switched to the ILS frequency then selected green needles. This process was attempted a number times as the selected mode on the control panel did not match the PFD FMA mode. Also once green needles were selected; the ILS course had to be selected as well. After a couple of calls from Wilkes Barre Approach had distracted our attempts to resolve the anomaly; I was considering discontinuing the approach as I was becoming task saturated with the inability of the flight mode control panel to present the selected mode in the PFD FMA. This was about the time we got the terrain warning. I responded to the terrain warning as I had the terrain on my side in sight and the First Officer said he had the towers in sight. Not sure if the terrain warning was for the terrain or the towers and I do not recall what our altitude was. Also due to the glare reflecting on parts of my MFD and PFD I was not able to clearly see the approaching terrain depiction until the terrain aural warnings sounded. As I initiated an immediate climb the terrain aural warning ceased and the very small terrain depiction disappeared from my MFD.The NOTAMs indicated the GS for ILS 4 was out of service so we had originally planned for the RNAV 04.I had sent an ACARS (I think about XX minutes out) requesting the current METAR; this indicated that the CIG was going to be below the adjusted minimum for the RNAV 04 approach which had been originally planned on and loaded in the FMS. We were discussing changing it to the ILS 04 with Glide Slope inoperative as the minimums were lower than the RNAV or requesting the ILS 22. As we were getting closer to AVP we were beginning to receive parts of the ATIS which indicated the ILS 04 was in use. Once the decision was made to made to load ILS 04 into the FMS; our time remaining to brief the approach and complete the descent checklist was somewhat compressed. As this airport is NOTAMed a 5G airport causing the radar altimeter to become unreliable; my concern is that this could have been a contributing factor. At some point approaching JISAG (the final approach fix); I must have selected a lower altitude and must have inadvertently initiated a descent before I had intended to.Should have discontinued the approach and requested vectors to the final approach course. Perhaps Wilkes Barre Approach should be made aware of the poor reception of the ATIS broadcast on the LVZ VOR. Also this approach should be issued or accepted only by vectors to intercept the localizer outside of HEAPP intersection and not a 30 degree intercept to the localizer. This aircrossing HEAPP intersection is where the obstacles are located and this could easily happen again if the auto tuning function fails.Due to the ATIS being broadcast on the Wilkes Barre LVZ VOR; it had to be manually selected to receive the ATIS. The reception was poor and it had to be listened to a number of times to hear it in its entirety. Once the ATIS was obtained the AUTO function was reselected on both NAV 1 and 2. However it must not have taken as the ghost needles on each PFD were never presented. At some point approaching JISAG (the final approach fix); I must have selected a lower altitude and must have inadvertently initiated a descent before I had intended to. Not sure if Wilkes Barre Approach is aware that the ATIS broadcast on the LVZ VOR is not easy to hear in the best of conditions. Also as this airport is NOTAMed as an airport where the radar altimeter maybe unreliable whether or not this could also have been a contributing factor.
Environment - Non Weather Related,Terrain warning on approach to visual Runway 34 at ROA on left base leg.Suggestion - Closely monitor altitude and descent rate on approach.Cause - The inherent terrain in ROA Associated with the visual approach.
Aircraft,On the ZZZZZ Arrival direct to ZZZZZ1; there was weather over ZZZZZ2 and ATC allowed us to deviate as necessary; direct ZZZ when able. GPS XX was in use. We proceeded direct to ZZZZZ3 because that kept us east of most of the weather. We were at 22;000 ft. in light rain and occasional light chop. My gain was +1 and only painting green. Suddenly; there was a loud pop and the CA (Captain)-side windshield shattered. A few seconds later; ATC descended us to 19;000 ft. and speed 250. I immediately asked the FO (First Officer) to ask for lower and let ATC know our windshield is cracked and damaged. They did and ATC asked if we wanted to [request priority handling]. We [requested priority handling] and ATC gave us 11;000 ft. I expedited our descent with flight spoilers but maintained speed 250 due to the damaged windshield.I then called for the windshield cracked or damaged QRC/QRH in the NON-MESSAGES section. The FO ran that down to Step X; When Below 8000 ft. We then transferred controls and I ran procedure items with the FAs; made a quick PA; and ACARS'd Maintenance Control. ATC asked reason for the cracked windshield; souls; and fuel onboard. I gave them that and told them possible hail. By the time I finished that; we were well below 8;000 ft. and I finished the QRH. As we were turning onto the approach; we agreed to let the FO maintain controls since her side was good; it was raining in ZZZ; and ceilings were 800 ft. We transferred the Flight Director. As I was starting the Descent Checklist; the FO called for the Before Landing Checklist. I completed both checklists. We fully configured at the FAF; [was] stable shortly after; and the FO made a great approach. We cancelled the [priority handling] after clearing the runway.
Aircraft,EICAS advisory message 'HYD1 LO QTY' as we were given our initial descent into ZZZ. First Officer (FO) was Pilot Flying (PF) Captain (CA) was Pilot Monitoring (PM). PM ran QRH; noticed pressure going down than EICAS CAUTION MSG 'HYD SYS 1 FAIL.' PM ran QRH unable to recover with pump ON; and let PF know to slow below 250 kts. due to gear doors. PF at time continued to ZZZ since we were in range. CA complied with QRH as well as confirmed all items with FO. Once we realized we would not have outboard breaking and steering we requested priority handling. I let Dispatch know via ACARS and Flight Attendant and Passengers. We tried calling Ops to let them know we would need tow but we're unsuccessful. Than before beginning approach CA swap with FO to become PF because of alternate gear extension. CA (PF) had to hand fly approach due to NAV 2 Failing as well. AP was unable to capture. Landed ZZZ we had to stop on Runway CA made remain seated call out; advised Tower we had no steering and had to get towed to Gate. At Gate we noticed lots of fluid from nose wheel area.
Aircraft,Upon descent into ZZZ the HYD 1 LO QTY Advisory message appeared on the EICAS. The FO (First Officer) was the PF (Pilot Flying); and the CA (Captain) was the PM (Pilot Monitoring) at the time. As the CA ran the QRH; he observed the pressure dropping; followed by the EICAS Caution message HYD SYS 1 FAIL. The CA ran the QRH; was unable to recover hyd sys 1 with the pump on; and instructed the PF to slow to below 250. The CA complied with and confirmed the QRH with the FO. Once the flight crew had requested priority handling (due to degraded braking and loss of nose wheel steering); notified the FA (Flight Attendant) and the Passengers; and notified the company via ACARS; they swapped roles; with the CA as the PF and the FO as the PM (due to FO actuating the Free Fall Lever for gear extension; and also a concurrent NAV 2 failure). The crew also tried to get hold of Operations for a tow but was unable. The CA had to hand fly the approach - Visual Runway XX-  because the AP did not capture. After landing the Flight Crew stopped on the runway; the CA made his remain seated announcement; and the crew coordinated with Tower; getting an exterior inspection and a tow back to the ramp. At the gate; the Flight Crew noted fluid leaking from the nose gear compartment.
Aircraft,We experienced an odor event with a return to airport. On taxi out there was a slight wet sock odor but it dissipated quickly after second engine start. After takeoff during climb out the flight attendants called us complaining of an odor throughout the cabin. We also noticed the odor and decided to level at 17;000 ft. and take radar vectors to assess the situation. We contacted Dispatch on the local frequency. We originally were planning on returning to ZZZ but at level off the odor started to dissipate. We conferenced with the Flight Attendants and all agreed the odor had dissipated and we agreed to continue on to ZZZ1. Once we started to climb the odor came back. The Flight Attendants reported it smelled like burning crayons. We decided returning to ZZZ quickly was the best course of action. Dispatch was notified. Upon decent we decided to [receive priority] because customers and crew were complaining of headache and dizziness. We reached the gate and did not start the APU considering it may have highly contributed to the odor. I felt the odor was slightly dissipating on arrival into ZZZ. EMS was at the gate to attend to any customers and crew that may have felt symptoms which all of the crew and some customers used.
Aircraft,Approaching 140W enroute to ZZZ-ZZZ1. Loss of Air Data Computer Left and Primary Altimeter Source in RVSM Airspace. Complied with QRH. After selection of reversionary mode of Right ADC crew received multiple Auto Pilot Caution messages; loss of VNAV vertical navigation mode; IRUs operating in split operational mode; Stall Warn Sys Status MSG; Rudder Ratio Status MSG; BTB 3 Status MSG; Erroneous speed tape maneuver margins displayed. Coordinated with Dispatch via SATCOM after reviewing RVSM contingency procedures. Joint crew decision in coordination with Maintenance; Dispatch; and Duty Pilot to divert to ZZZ2. Coordinated revised clearance with [Center] to ZZZ2 and complied with RVSM Contingency procedures. Normal Arrival; Approach; Landing in ZZZ2. All defects noted in aircraft maintenance log.Loss of ADC L and AOA Fault causing erroneous information and loss of primary Altimeter in RVSM airspace. RVSM Contingency procedures used. Using all available resources decided best course of action to divert to ZZZ2 in the event ATC could not accommodate our RVSM degraded capabilities.Unknown origin of mechanical defects inflight. Followed procedures in QRH; FCOM; FOM. Joint coordination with Dispatch; Maintenance; ATC.
Aircraft,Weather at ZZZ: 270/11; Unlimited Vis; 29.41'; FEW 5;000 ft. While completing Leg 3 of 3 Legs for the day from ZZZ1 to ZZZ in Airbus 319. I was Pilot Flying (PF); we were executing a Visual Approach; backed by the ZZZ ILS XXL. Approach vectored us for Left Base at 2;000 ft. MSL; we were cleared for the Visual Approach at; we descended to 1;700 ft. MSL and intercepted the LOC while in a Flaps 2 Config; at 170 KIAS; as we approach the Glide Slope; approximately 5 miles from Runway XXL; vicinity of ZZZZZ Int. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) lowered the Gear Handle; as requested; and we received a Caution Light and ECAM message the Landing Gear Doors (L/G DOORS NOT CLOSED). I continued flying and PM Checked the QRC; and ECAM steps; no actions were stipulated/required. The ECAM was showing all three Landing Gear down and 'green'; we were completed configuring. We confirmed proper configuration for landing. We concluded that the best course was to continue the approach. PM stated we would not have Steering upon landing; and informed ZZZ Tower of our status. The rest of the approach and landing was completed normally and safely. Upon reaching 60 kts.; as briefed; I transferred the controls to the Captain; who confirmed the tiller (steering) was not working. I informed ZZZ Tower we indeed did not have steering and we would attempt to clear the active runway. The Captain was able to use differential braking to clear the active Runway (XXL) onto Runway XY (not in use); this was coordinated with ZZZ Tower. We informed Company Operations of our situation; with assistance from Airport Authority (Command) and Company Tug (Ramp Crew) we were towed into Gate XX.
Aircraft,This event took place during a flight from ZZZZ destined for ZZZ1. The inbound crew had experienced an ELAC1 fault in cruise late in the flight which resolved to normal operations somewhere in the descent. I was deadheading in the cabin on the inbound flight and was advised of the ELAC issue at the gate where I took the place of the FO (First Officer) who operated the inbound flight. He was illegal for the leg back to ZZZ1 and took a seat in the cabin to deadhead back to ZZZ1. Maintenance was advised of the issue on the inbound flight and Mechanics came onboard to evaluate. No remaining problems were found and the aircraft was deemed safe for flight. Departure; climb and initial cruise at FL380 were normal until about two hours into the flight. First we got an ELAC1 pitch trim fault and automatic autopilot disconnect. There were no ECAM actions to perform and we reengaged the autopilot. While analyzing the effect of the failure we got an ELAC2 pitch trim fault and the autopilot disconnected once again. The Captain requested a descent from ZZZZ Center as we were no longer RVSM compliant and then he called the 1st FA (Flight Attendant) and requested the deadheading FO be sent to the cockpit. Having the extra crew member in the cockpit was very helpful as he assisted with the radios; systems research and a variety of other tasks. I was hand flying the descent to FL260 and then FL240 due to turbulence while the three of us discussed our options. Although the display said to use manual trim; the trim wheel was frozen in place and could not be adjusted. Control pressure in pitch was light and even though we had no pitch trim available; hand flying the aircraft was not difficult. At this point we were in alternate law and even though control was not difficult; hand flying the aircraft required constant adjustments and was significantly touchier than hand flying a fully functional aircraft. The Captain attempted to contact Maintenance but was unsuccessful. We decided the situation warranted [an alert] and since ZZZ2 appeared significantly closer we decided to divert. After further discussion of our frozen pitch trim we decided advising ATC was appropriate. En route to ZZZ2 we were given lengthy vectors around military airspace which was unexpected since we had requested priority handling. In the descent to ZZZ2 the pitch trim became usable again and the approach and landing were uneventful.
Aircraft,At FL400 in cruise flight we received a Cabin Altitude warning; EICAS and annunciation. Cabin altitude was above 10;000 ft. and rising. We performed the QRH procedure donning oxygen; [advising ATC] and requested a descent to FL250. Upon reaching FL250 the cabin altitude stabilized at 4;000 ft. Based on fuel calculations we determined it was safe to continue the flight to ZZZ. We landed without further incident.The aircraft pressurization system failed to maintain cabin altitude.I am not aware of any policies or procedures that if changed would have prevented this event.
Aircraft,Aircraft X was on final approach to ZZZ. The crew received an asymmetric flap indication upon final approach. The crew went around and re-configured the aircraft for landing. The aircraft then landed in ZZZ without incident. Upon landing it was discovered that the inboard slats did not extend; and the outboard flaps had extended fully.
Human Factors,On final descent into ZZZ We called the field in sight and ATC cleared us for a Visual landing Runway XX at 12 miles south of the field. I set 1600 in the altitude preselector for the final approach fix ZZZZZ. I was planning to be level just prior to ZZZZZ. I started down in VS mode and disconnected the auto pilot and called for my flight director to be removed. Approximately 4 miles from ZZZZZ we got an EGPWS alert I began responding to the warning by pulling the nose up and adding thrust. Once the alert subsided I refocused on the airport and did not notice I had resumed descending. As I turned down the final approach I was under 1;000 ft. Above Field Elevation with flaps 8 and nothing else. My Line Check Airmen called we would be unstable so I elected to go-around. We then flew a left traffic pattern and landed without further incident.
Human Factors,We were waiting to park at [the] gate at ORF. The ramp crew was pushing back Aircraft Y at [an adjacent] gate. Once they completed the push the Ramp Crew came over to marshal us in. We were waiting at the taxi line to taxi into the gate; we saw the Marshaler signal us to start taxiing into the gate so the Captain released the parking brake and started moving. This is when the [other] aircraft decided to start moving and taxi in between us and the terminal. They were nowhere near the ramp taxi line as we were on it. This non standard maneuver put both aircraft and everyone on board at risk as they came quite close to us. Not only that; they also put the ramp crew at risk. The Captain had to slam on the brakes as we were both startled by the actions of the other aircraft. A little patience would have prevented this unnecessary risk.
Aircraft,We were cleared for takeoff; I stood the throttles up to 1.1 EPR; commenced the takeoff roll at approximately 80/85 kts. an EICAS message 'UNSCHED STAB TRIM' in yellow appeared. Captain commanded control of the aircraft and aborted the takeoff. I followed him through on the abort procedures. I advised the Tower we were aborting the takeoff and announced we would taxi clear the runway. The Relief Pilot advised passengers and cabin crew to remain seated. We held on a taxiway while consulting with Maintenance and the BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System) chart in the FM. We waited for the brakes to cool before setting the parking brake. We learned from Maintenance that this message had occurred three times in the past ten days in flight on this airplane. Based on discussions with Maintenance and our crew; we collectively decided a gate return would be prudent to allow Maintenance an opportunity to investigate further.Maintenance boarded the aircraft and initially suggested repeating the same procedure for the previous occurrences of this same problem.  They did some more troubleshooting and decided to replace a module in the equipment bay. Based on further detailed discussions with Maintenance; we felt the replacement of the module did not improve their confidence nor ours that the root cause of the problem was addressed.  The crew met and discussed our thoughts and the fact that this problem was now determined to be chronic because of the multiple occurrences within ten days; the possibility of another RTO due to the low confidence that the problem was understood; and out of an abundance of caution due to passengers fear we felt the right thing to do was to allow Maintenance adequate time to troubleshoot the problem; determine the root cause and; address it before the airplane would be allowed to fly again.
Equipment / Tooling,After silent push was used; Ramp cleared us to push from Gate XX to Spot XX. I relayed the push instructions to the CA (Captain) who then instructed the Tug Driver to push us to Spot XX. During the push process; unknown to the CA and I; the Tug Driver's wireless headset stopped working. Simultaneously; as we were pushing; Ramp revised our push clearance to just push tail west. I again relayed the information to the CA who attempted to talk with the Tug Driver. Due to the lost comm with the Tug Driver; the CA was unable to instruct the Tug Driver of the revised push clearance. The CA flashed the taxi light to get the Tug Driver's attention. It was dark so the taxi light was extremely intense on the Tug Driver's eyes. The Tug Driver braked hard and to the best of our knowledge; the tow bar become unattached and possibly broke. Maintenance was called out to inspect the aircraft nose landing gear. The Tug Driver re-established communication with his headset. He was a bit upset with the CA's decision to flash the taxi light. The Tug Driver; however; stated that he was aware of the lost comm; but was going to re-establish communication 'after' he had pushed us to Spot XX. The CA informed him that was precisely the problem because our clearance had changed. Maintenance inspected the aircraft; and cleared the aircraft back into service; and we proceeded uneventfully to ZZZ.
Aircraft,While enroute from ZZZ to ZZZ1 at FL350; an ECAM for HYD Y RSVR LO LVL appeared with a Master Caution. As the PM (Pilot Monitoring); I began running the ECAM at the Captain's direction. Completing the ECAM resulted in the disabling of the Yellow hydraulic system and an associated landing distance procedure.The Captain transferred PF (Pilot Flying) and ATC duties to me while he contacted Dispatch and Maintenance for discussion of the condition. The quality of the communication with Dispatch/Maintenance via ARINC radio was poor; and it was very difficult to hear and understand the transmissions from the ground. It is unclear if this was due to the radio reception quality or if it was an issue with the phone patch. The aircraft was at FL350 about 80-100 miles south of ZZZ2 at the time of the communications.During the discussion with Dispatch and Maintenance; our understanding was that the decision to divert was at our discretion. We reviewed the FM/QRH non-normal procedure in its entirety and reviewed the FOM guidance in Section 2.10. As a crew we considered the following factors: the FOM guidance for [requesting priority handling]; the unknown cause of the malfunction; the night conditions; and the approaching mountainous terrain. ZZZ2 airport was relatively close at the time; with ZZZ3 being significantly farther away and across remote mountainous terrain.We concluded that diverting to ZZZ2 was the most prudent course of action. Dispatch was informed of our desire and intention to divert to ZZZ2. Dispatch acknowledged this diversion and informed us that they would begin coordinating for our diversion and arrival at ZZZ2. We subsequently received landing distance information for Runway XXR at ZZZ2 from Dispatch.After informing ATC of our intention to divert to ZZZ2; I began the process of diverting to ZZZ2 while the Captain informed the Flight Attendants and passengers of the diversion. When he had completed these tasks; we briefed the arrival into ZZZ2 and the Captain resumed PF duties for the approach and landing in ZZZ2. We completed the ECAM approach procedure and landed at approximately XA:00am. The only abnormality of the landing in ZZZ2 was a slightly overweight condition of approximately 139;500 lbs. (landing distance was calculated for 150;000 lbs).After landing we stopped the aircraft clear of the runway to complete flows and assess the hydraulic situation. After concluding that normal taxiing could continue; we were advised to park on a hardstand near ramp Spot XX. The Airport Operations Personnel were of great assistance in parking and deplaning the aircraft using stairs and a bus. The communication and support from ZZZ2 ATC and airport operations was excellent. ARFF personnel assisted with the deplaning of a handicapped passenger.Once all passengers had deplaned; we completed the termination checklist and departed the aircraft. Outside the aircraft; we observed what appeared to be hydraulic fluid significantly covering the underside of the fuselage and dripping onto the ramp below.
Human Factors,While holding in position on runway; ATC issued modified takeoff clearance to turn right heading 010 and climb to 2;000 feet after takeoff as opposed to runway heading 3;000. After taking off in VMC conditions; as briefed; the Captain (PF (Pilot Flying)) initiated a right turn to 010. Climbing through 1600 we received a 'traffic traffic' warning from TCAS. Concurrently ATC advised us of the traffic but did not issue an alert. We had visual contact with the traffic at that point. Through 1700; the resolution advisory started; saying 'level off level off'. The Captain leveled off at 2000 and rolled out on heading 010. I advised ATC that we were complying with a TCAS resolution advisory and were level. The traffic passed approximately 500 ft. above from left to right; and TCAS announced clear of conflict. I advised ATC we were clear of conflict and they issued a climb to 10;000 ft. on the same heading; ending the event.As far as we could tell; ATC could have cleared us for takeoff straight out and then turned us behind the traffic.Given our departure off of Runway 28 and our initial fix of JROSS; which was nearly the opposite direction; ATC may have been trying to give us a shortcut by modifying our climb clearance to 2;000 instead of 3;000 so they could immediately turn us closer to JROSS. It is unclear whether the Controller planned for us to turn inside or outside of the traffic; however we ending up going nearly right under the traffic; and seemingly with less than required vertical separation. This conflict was unavoidable given the clearance received.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,Aircraft X was en route from ZZZ to ZZZ1. About 17nm south of SPI Aircraft X advises they had a crop duster fly by within 300 ft. Upon immediate observation I advised I saw no traffic within Aircraft X's immediate vicinity; there were no VFR tags nor any tagged traffic anywhere near him. I then noticed a primary target tracking from east to west; something I assumed was a false target as we have had frequent issues with false targets recently; especially in that area. Recurring problems with false targets made me complacent towards issuing traffic on primary targets; especially in the areas they most often occur. Despite countless recent traffic calls on false targets; the one time I didn't call traffic and assumed it was an error it turned out to be a high altitude crop duster not talking to ATC. In the future I'll be diligent to call traffic on primary; questionable targets; regardless of large areas of predominantly false targets on my scope.
Human Factors,Typical situation; we were getting ready to push back; Ramp Agent came up and gave us HAZMAT Dangerous Goods Form for an aircraft battery. I quizzed Agent on each entry on the item line; getting a verbal confirmation that all data is accurate; but then I got back to what I was doing and missed the requirement to call Dispatch and confirm the Release was amended. We noticed; shortly after departure; the comment on the Dangerous Goods Form and ACARSd Dispatch and got the Release amended.
Human Factors,At 500 AGL Too Low Flap audible sounded indicating flaps were incorrect. This was a complete surprise as we had configured and completed the before landing checklist. Turbulence was encountered during approach and I can only surmise my hand was still on the flap handle when we hit a downdraft and I may have move the handle out of the detent. When alarm sounded I reached down and handle was out of the detent and I reset the handle at flaps 30. Alarm silenced and we landed without incident.
Human Factors,We were flying a Visual Approach to Runway XXR at ZZZ. At about 1500 ft. MSL; Tower offered us Runway XXL; seemingly due to closeness of the aircraft in front of us. We were given 160 kts. until the marker; and had not configured to our final flaps (30). When we accepted Runway XXL; I 'went inside' and re-tuned to the Runway XXL Localizer. We made the 1000 ft. call; but had not fully configured. We got a 'Too Low; Flaps' alert and I selected flaps 30. I had 'tunnel vision'; focusing on the approach profile; which was normal; and didn't call for a go-around. We continued the approach and landing.Don't accept a runway change close in. We should have gone around when we got the alert. Aviate first; (complete configuring); then Navigate (I was distracted when I re-tuned and we really didn't need the new localizer to fly the visual); then Communicate (we both missed the Before Landing Checklist).
Human Factors,We were flying the Stadium Visual Runway 29 approach with a speed restriction of 170 kts. to SLIMR. The approach was well-briefed and the automation was set up in LNAV VNAV Path; autopilot and auto throttle engaged with touchdown zone elevation set in the MCP altitude window immediately after GIMEE. Additionally; we had inserted COPKO on the legs page after SLIMR and before CHUMR. We'd planned on being in final landing configuration by SLIMR and we were able to have the gear down and the flaps to 15 but we held off the final flaps momentarily approaching SLIMR due to the ATC speed restriction and the lower flap limiting speeds of [this] aircraft. At this point; I became aware that the approach happens more quickly than I expected and that we had a manageable amount of excess energy. Passing SLIMR; we reduced airspeed but two unusual things happened. First; the Tower Controller advised us to slow to final approach airspeed and said 'Low Altitude Alert'. I'm still unsure if the low altitude alert was for us because it looked like we were high if anything. The other thing was our vertical guidance went away and the autopilot reverted to [a degraded mode]. I instructed my First Officer to turn off the autopilot. He did; and did a great job of hand flying from there. I got the flaps to final and the checklist complete. We descended to and captured a normal visual glide path by approximately 500 ft. AGL. The rest of the landing was uneventful.
Human Factors,"Hand-flying the JCOBY4 RNAV departure out of IAD. Leveling off at 10;000 [ft.] and accelerating to 280 knots. Departure clears direct GRIIM; I begin the turn towards GRIIM by hand. FO selects GRIIM in FMC and executes; just as we hit moderate wake turbulence. I was task-saturated with the acceleration; turn and reacting to the wake turbulence; and do not know if FO ever engaged LNAV. I stopped [the] turn at what I believed pointed at GRIIM; but must have been about 30 degrees short. Shortly after; departure issued a 'Turn immediately to 150 deg. I made the turn; and during the turn got a TCAS TA. We determined that the traffic was no longer a threat; and I engaged the autopilot. Departure asked if we could go directly to GRIIM; and we replied 'Yes.' I then watched FO bring GRIIM to the top of the FMC; execute; and I engaged LNAV. The plane began to turn the wrong way; so I went to Heading Select and turned back towards GRIIM. I asked the FO to hand-type GRIIM back into the FMC and; since we were very near the way point; sequence the next way point. He was trying to re-enter the whole departure; I looked at the Jepp and determined that SOOKI was there; after a discontinuity. I removed the discontinuity; executed; engaged LNAV; and the plane made the proper turn. No further difficulties encountered for the rest of the flight."""
Human Factors,While in the descent; approaching 10;000 feet; the lead flight attendant called the flight deck to report that the passenger seated in seat X had a personal electronic charging device which had overheated and was smoking. They reported that they had doused it with water and put it in their thermal containment bag. They confirmed that the situation was resolved. We continued the descent and approach. We flew the ILS to Runway XXR and landed uneventfully. The thermal containment bag was placed in an aft galley cart. After parking; I sent a Maintenance Request to Maintenance; called Operations to let them know that the thermal containment bag was given to the customer service representative; and left a message with the Chief Pilot voicemail.
Aircraft,While on arrival into ZZZZ; I was advised of fumes ('Burning Wood' smell) in middle passenger cabin by No. 1 FA (Flight Attendant). Unable to identify source of smell. Smell dissipated then returned stronger 5 minutes after first notification. At approximately 30nm from ZZZZ; [priority received]; appropriate checklists completed; passengers briefed; normal landing accomplished. Stopped aircraft on high speed Taxiway XX. ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) investigated and did not observe fire or smoke from exterior. Fumes again dissipated once on ground. Taxied to gate; deplaned passengers via 1L door (normal). Fume event entered in AML (Aircraft Maintenance Logbook).[Priority received] out of an abundance of caution; as event recurred in a short period of time and while descending to land.The ability of cockpit crewmember to proceed to cabin to personally observe/smell the odor. FA's had trouble agreeing on what odor smelled like.
Human Factors,I taxied into the gate. After the marshaler crossed his wands; I thought I set the parking brake. I then shut the engines down and went through my shut down flow and called for the shutdown checklist. As the First Officer was about to begin the checklist; I noticed the marshaler trying to get my attention. At the same time I noticed the aircraft start to slowly roll back. I immediately applied and the set the brakes. The aircraft rolled back about two to three feet. After completing the checklist I did a check on all crew; passengers; rampers; and the aircraft. There were no injuries to the people and no damage to the aircraft. When the aircraft rolled back; there were no people; equipment; or structures near the plane.I believe I might have been too preoccupied with helping my First Officer. He was freshly off IOE and I had been giving him guidance on the arrival into ZZZ. It was his leg and I had been helping him. I believe when I went to shut down; I was still thinking about his flight and what advice I could give him. This does not excuse me from my duties though. I am the Captain and I still need to fulfill my primary duties no matter whom I'm flying with. This was a good learning experience for me. As I said above; I am the Captain and I need to fulfill duties; which also means knowing when I can divide my attention and when I need to focus solely on the task at hand. The flight isn't truly done until the parking brake is set and the engines are off and the shutdown checklist is complete. I have definitely learned from this situation.
Aircraft,On take-off from Runway XXR at ZZZ; right after V1; but before rotating; we both felt a sharp left yaw torque on the plane. Vr took about 3 or 4 seconds longer to get to than we are used to. There was some gusty wind; but not THAT bad. We were still right near centerline; as it was sharp but of short duration. We both agreed about the feeling and the slow acceleration after take-off. We had no other anomalies; no noises; and no Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System messages. Both of us pilots discussed this during the climb-out. I asked the flight attendant if she'd heard any noise or felt this jerk. She had not heard noise; but had felt the motion. We both speculated if this was a tire problem; so I wrote Maintenance Control; with cc to dispatcher with solicitation of ideas. Maintenance eventually asked about anti-skid or brake overheat; but we replied in the negative. We considered that the anti-skid caution message doesn't last long until the gear comes up; so we could have missed it. We also considered whether one of us had been on one brake during Take-off; but that was not likely. After one more query of Maintenance; with no reply recommendation; I noted that with the strong crosswinds and medium to short runway at ZZZ1; we'd be erring on the side of caution by checking this out before just setting down. Considering the fact that we could have to leave the gear down (for a tire problem) or need 1.75 times the runway (for an anti-skid problem - not requiring a fly-by; of course); we saw that with our decent amount of extra fuel (1100 lbs.) we could get to ZZZ2 safely no matter what. (Still crosswinds; but 9000 ft.) I wrote dispatcher to let her know the plan. While I did that; I asked the non-flying pilot to let the Flight Attendant first; and then the passengers; know that'd we'd do a low fly-by just to check out a possible tire problem. The Flight Attendant at one point said one pilot on board wanted to talk to me; so I talked for a minute on the intercom with him. A former R/J pilot; he understood what I'd said; but told me that he thought the P/A to the passengers wasn't clear. After we flew over at 400 ft. we were told no anomalies by both the Tower and 2 RJ pilots in the hold pad. As I did a VFR pattern back around; the non-flying pilot let the passengers know we were fine and we'd be down in 5 minutes. Due to major problems with gate space and personnel we had a 20 minute wait in a holding spot; during which I followed up with Maintenance and Dispatcher and then told the passengers more of the story. I noted no anomalies during post-flight walk-around inspection. We don't know any cause for the take-off anomaly. I'd just never felt this kind of jerk before; and figured we'd be safer checking it out.About the pilot-passenger and the announcement. I considered his opinion on the communication. However; I'd already discussed with the other pilot that we'd keep it short and just let them know we'd do this as a precaution; with no need for a bunch of details. I noted that the other pilot made it pretty quick; and she told me later it was pretty much like I'd said; just short with an explanation ahead of time of why we'd come in first without landing and with no reason to alarm anyone. I have trust in the other pilots to make good communications to the passenger. There was no reason for any preparations for the Flight Attendant; as there was no emergency. If we'd have found a problem; then we would have communicated with everyone; Maintenance; Dispatch; the Flight Attendant; and finally the passengers; about the new plan. This passenger-pilot apparently had a problem with our handling of this as he had complained to the Flight Attendant while the other pilot was looking for food and setting up things for the return (very late at this point); and I was post-flighting; checking/calculating the loads for the outbound flight; using the bathroom; and getting a candy bar. Neither of us had a chance to explain anything to him. Finally; I will say that ZZZ Approach and the ZZZ1 Tower were most helpful. Nothing needed to be expedited; but they communicated well and arranged things for us.
Aircraft,Cleared to line up and wait after two minutes cleared for take-off. On beginning of take-off roll; aircraft veered far left on power up while advancing thrust levers; aircraft had no directional control even with large rudder input. Both engines spooled up normally but center line could not be maintained so take-off was discontinued at a very slow speed roughly taxi speeds. Nose wheel steering tiller still worked and we vacated the runway normally per ATC instructions.
Procedure,We were descending via the OHSEA 2 into SNA in VFR conditions. We were cleared for the RNAV Z approach for Runway 20R. We set the MCP to field elevation and were descending via VNAV. Prior to KLEVR; ATC canceled the RNAV approach and told us to expect the ILS and gave us a vector. We switched the approach to the ILS in the FMC and ran the change triangle checklist items. After our second vector we noticed that the ALT selector was still set to field elevation for the previously assigned RNAV approach. We asked ATC what altitude he wanted us at which he replied 3000 ft. (the altitude we were currently at) and that we were cleared the ILS approach. We flew the ILS approach and landed with no further incident.When we were given the approach change last minute; our task saturation increased dramatically. We did verify the MCP was set for the ILS; but initially missed the ALT selector. The lesson learned here was that when you are vectored off an RNAV approach; to make sure the new hard altitude is set and verified in the MCP. This was a good example of CRM that trapped and mitigated and error. In the future; I plan to 'walk the panel' in its entirety anytime an approach change occurs.
Human Factors,2 day inspection was being performed without the pilots or anyone being informed; and without the logbook. The plane was blocked out; with the beacon on; and after departure time when local Maintenance began working on the plane and opening up the engines. Luckily the pilots caught the issue in time and prevented a disaster.
Human Factors,On short final inadvertently went below glideslopes and PAPI. Landing uneventful.
Aircraft,Fumes event during flight. Noxious and toxic fumes filled the entire aircraft cabin and flight-deck during approach and landing/taxi. All occupants onboard were exposed to these fumes for more than 18 minutes. My crew of 6 and I experienced varying degrees of significant symptoms including; sore throat; burning runny eyes; hoarse vocals; light headedness; dizziness; concentration issues and breathing irritation during and immediately following this event. I used supplemental oxygen when I realized that the fumes were getting worse. I remained on O2 through landing. During deplaning I overheard several passengers concerns of exposure to toxic chemicals and fumes during flight.I made a logbook entry clearly stating we had a Heavy Noxious Fumes Event. After a brief post flight inspection of the engines maintenance techs discovered potential mechanical disintegration of an engine resulting in large metal fragments present in the oil. They grounded the aircraft for engine replacement saying 'This plane has major problems!' The maintenance staff smelt the residual toxic fumes on board. I don't think I bought off on previous fumes events entirely. I'm a believer now! This event was dangerous and could have been much worse. We were fortunate to land safely. Even though we just had this significant fumes event; my crew and I were encouraged by the Company to reluctantly fly another scheduled leg that same evening without evaluation by a medical professional. When queried on fumes exposure processes or procedures and med evaluation; company reps told me they didn't think any existed. When I spoke with MedAire at my hotel on my symptoms I was told I should not have flown after the fumes exposure.
Human Factors,During breakdown of mail PMC. 1 piece mail was found with a CAO (Cargo Aircraft Only) label. The box was screened. The box seemed to contain a notebook/ipad. The box have been forwarded to mail center; for further investigation.
Ambiguous,I was the Captain and flying pilot on [a flight to] EINN. This event occurred during the approach phase of flight in VMC and light winds. After coast in off the NATs we were advised of radar contact and subsequently cleared direct to ELPOM; the IF for ILS or LOC Runway 06. We were cleared for several descents with a final clearance to descend to 3000 ft. on 1031 hectopascals. At 3000 ft. outside ELPOM I began to slow for the approach and we were cleared for the ILS Runway 06. With the autopilot still engaged I armed the approach and checked the FMA to see that LOC and GS were armed. Moments later the LOC and GS captured at exactly the same time and our ASA switched to NO AUTOLAND while our raw data GS indicator began acting erratic. As we were in VMC conditions with the FMA confirming LOC and GS capture and I had the runway visually I elected to continue the approach despite the anomalies. At about 2600 ft. with reference to outside cues I lost confidence in the Glide Slope indication I was following and confirmed my concerns with my First Officer. I disengaged the autopilot and began a climb back to 3000 ft. to reestablish a visual approach and try and recapture a true Glide Slope. At that time we received a low altitude alert from Shannon Control. We advised Control we understood and confirmed we were returning to 3000 ft. I continued to fly the approach visually as the First Officer turned both FDs off then on in an attempt to reestablish some instrument guidance for the approach. At the final approach fix of ASGON with the approach reprogrammed by the First Officer all indicators began to settle down and the GS indication on the FD seemed to be giving me guidance I could trust. I continued the approach to an uneventful landing and taxied to gate; after completion of the parking check list; the First Officer and I debriefed the event.
Aircraft,When the event occurred the Captain and I had been at rest in the crew rest seats for 20-30 minutes.  I was resting in seat 1A; the seat has a curtain around it.  I awoke because felt the airframe jostle side to side; and heard some noises that sounded to me like a compressor stall.  As I was collecting myself a Flight Attendant came through the curtain and alerted me that they needed me up front.  She said we had lost an engine.  When I arrived at the cockpit door I saw the Captain just shutting the door behind her as she entered the flight deck. I got in front of the beverage cart at that time and knocked twice before I was let in.  When I arrived inside the flight deck; the Captain was already seated in the left seat. One of the relief First Officers was seated in the right seat; and the other relief First Officer was standing involved with reading a checklist aloud.  I took a seat in the jump seat aft of the control stand; and pulled the paper Quick Reference Handbook from the First Officers side to follow along; as my iPad was still in the mount on the First Officers side window.  The state of the aircraft at this moment was 5 miles right of track and descending at drift down speed to FL 250; with the autopilot on; auto-throttles off; right thrust lever at idle and right fuel control switch cutoff.  A SELCAL came in through HF. I don't recall who answered it or what was said; I was still trying to get caught up with the situation.I noticed at this moment the Right EGT gauge was in the red and had a red box around the digits; and the N1 indication was blanked; this N1 condition is indicative of engine severe damage. It was my understanding that the Captain was going back over the Quick Reference Handbook checklists at this point to make sure everything was done; and was trying to determine what type of engine problem we had.  I voiced my diagnosis of severe damage and drew the Captain's attention to the Blank N1 indicator as support.  In the sequence of the memory items the engine severe damage memory items the engine fire handle is to be pulled.The Captain made sure we were all in agreement that the condition we were experiencing was engine severe damage and that the fire handle was going to be pulled sealing the fate that we would not be getting that engine back during this flight.  We were all in agreement; and the right engine fire handle was pulled.  At the end of the memory items review from the Quick Reference Handbook made the sitting First Officer aware of the fact that my iPad was still in the mount and advised me I could go ahead and grab it.  I began to look for traffic outside; I put on a headset and began listening in; and I heard that we were in contact on HF; I heard multiple aircraft on guard offering to relay for us. I took another look at all of the panels at this point to determine if maybe something was missed; and I didn't find that there was anything missed; as I went through the Quick Reference Handbook and non-normal checklists on my iPad in silence.I began looking at my iPad for our position and route information and for alternates. We were near but just prior to our CP-2 flight planned critical point with planned alternates of ZZZZ2 and ZZZZ3. However; ZZZZ1 was determined to be the nearest airport.  It was not listed in the flight plan as an alternate; and I was not sitting in a position where I could help checking the Alternate page or determining the times to our considerations; or pulling ATIS reports or using any ACARS functions; so I elected to check the flight plan. ZZZZ1 weather TAFs were listed in the flight plan. Although the flight plan TAF information was not as desirable as more recent weather reports; at the time it stated probability of fog and mist; ZZZZ2 was predicted to be windy with rain showers; and ZZZZ3 was predicted calm and clear.  The Captain coordinated with dispatch by sat-phone; and the Dispatcher agreed that ZZZZ1 was a great option; due to weather; time; distance; and support on the ground. I believe at this point the Captain programmed the FMC to take us to ZZZZ1; which was nearly along our current course; and informed ATC of our intentions to go to ZZZZ1.  ATIS weather was requested. The Printer was very active with messages from the dispatcher; including weather and landing data for ZZZZ1.  The First Officer that was standing in the back near me determined the landing distance using the hyperlinks in the engine severe damage checklist which takes you directly to the inflight performance charts located in our flight manual; and informed the rest of the crew. I checked the OFP (Operational Flight Plan) for NOTAMs at ZZZZ1; but ZZZZ1 airport was not listed in the NOTAMs section; one of the other First Officers pulled the NOTAMs through [the electronic flight bag]; and indicated that they had been reviewed and no NOTAMs would affect us 'except maybe one'; but I forget what he said that was; and it didn't end up affecting us. At this point we had about an hour and twenty minutes; by my recollection; to landing. We split tasks amongst the crew; each of us scanning the panels; monitoring the flight path; and reviewing charts; reviewing all information from the printer; the captain gave the Flight Attendants a TEST brief; and made a PA to the passengers at some point during this portion of the time. I tried to help set up for the approach by monitoring the ATIS frequency for the moment that would come into listening range; and tuning and setting my radio up for identifying the ILS approach frequency.  The First Officer seated in the right seat needed a bathroom break at this point and I got in the seat for a moment; I made some radio responses during this time. Upon his return the other First Officer may have went to the restroom; but I don't recall for sure.  Very shortly after the bathroom run or runs; the crew decided to put the most experienced First Officer in the right seat for the remainder of the flight. At some point closer to the shoreline the captain elected to continue descent to FL200. I can't recall if this was in response to the minor airframe vibration we experienced or if that was unrelated; but the Captain was able to alleviate the vibration by with speed control.I monitored the rest of the flight from the jump seat aft of the center console. Nothing of significance arose during the remainder of the flight; the brakes did get warm (up to 5 on the Brake Temperature Monitoring System) during taxi in. Firefighters followed us into the gate and were also monitoring our aircraft using infrared technology. Upon arrival to the gate emergency personnel came to the flight deck and we discussed the brake temperatures and right engine temperatures; it was stated that they were decreasing and at a safe level.  The crew and all personnel on the ground determined it would be safe to disembark the aircraft. One First Officer put on a hat and jacket to greet the passengers upon disembarkation.  I worked on organizing and retaining all documents for the Captain and securing the aircraft with as much of the termination checklist as I could run under the circumstances.  No injuries were reported.
Software and Automation,Flying the ORD7 departure; PEKUE fix; the FMS had PEKUE loaded twice. We did not catch it on the route briefing. We got to PEKUE and the aircraft tried to make a right turn to circle over PEKUE again. We caught it and the First Officer quickly TCS'd to stay on course until I could fix the FMS. ATC did not say anything to us. This issue happened the last time I flew the ORD7 to a different fix. We luckily caught it in the route briefing. My suggestion is do not load the ORD7 into the FMS. There is no need as this departure is strictly radar vectors. There are no RNAV tracks anywhere on this departure either. Loading it into the FMS does absolutely nothing. The initial fix is part of the flight plan; and the departure itself is not even listed on the release. There is a glitch in our FMS database that's allowing this to happen. We did not change departure runways or anything that would've caused this.
Human Factors,We briefed the Approach [for] Runway XX before our descent. All fixes and crossing altitudes for the approach where entered into the FMS. After being cleared for the approach we crossed ZZZZZ waypoint at 1500ft and fully configured. The current descent rate to ZZZZZ1 was not enough to cross at the required altitude. PF then increased the descent rate and then disconnected the autopilot. Then before reached ZZZZZ1 Tower asked for us to 'square our turn to final.' The PF (Pilot Flying) crossed at the required altitude but with strong crosswind the A/C slightly crossed the inbound course to ZZZZZ2. We received one 'caution obstacle' aural that was corrected by the course reversal back to the right. The descent rate for the crossing at ZZZZZ1 had to be increased. The rate selected was more than intended. Then PF disconnected the autopilot to correct the descent and now hand flying the turn at ZZZZZ1 was not adjusted for the crosswind. Captain's Analysis:Descent management and situation awareness is a must. The Approach [for] Runway XX should have flown with autopilot because of the high work load and 90 degree turn at ZZZZZ1.
Human Factors,I was Pilot Monitoring; ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 descending on the ZZZZZ1 arrival cleared for the RNP XX. While on the arrival we were cleared to 6000 ft. and direct ZZZZZ2. As we descended I noticed a quick flash of a green laser at our 12 o'clock. It wasn't a direct hit; almost like they were sighting us in. It was so brief that I wasn't 100 percent sure that it was a laser. Nevertheless I immediately warned my Captain that we were being lasered from 12 o'clock and also reported it to Approach. Based on our position and altitude I initially reported that the laser came from the ridge line at our 12 o'clock. Approaching the ridge line we were hit a few more times and I suggested to my Captain that we turn off the lights so we couldn't be seen as easily; we did and I informed Approach that we were going dark. Once we turned the lights off the hits stopped.As we passed the ridge about 5 miles from ZZZZZ2 we figured the laser was behind us and turned the lights back on. We were immediately hit again with the green laser again from our 12 o'clock. This time the hits were precise. It was easier to see that the laser was coming from south of ZZZ3. I was surprised because we were between probably 15 to 20 miles from ZZZ3 when we turned the lights off initially; that was a powerful laser to reach us from that distance. Also why I mistook the strikes as coming from the ridge. These second series of strikes were accurate and persistent. I ducked my head below the glare-shield to block myself from the laser. We turned the lights back off and updated Approach on the laser origination. Turning the lights off helped with the accuracy but not persistency; they knew our general area and pointed the laser at us directly hitting us off and on consistently for several minutes. When we passed ZZZZZ3 the strikes stopped as the shooter was abeam our left side and slightly behind us. The good thing was at one point I got a somewhat accurate position on the location; the bad news was I took a hit. Inside ZZZZZ4 my Captain mentioned that he took a direct hit and that he was feeling the onset of a headache which made sense because he was on the side of the laser when we turned over ZZZZZ2. Despite taking a hit myself my night vision was still good and I didn't feel any adverse conditions so I offered to take control of the jet. He said he felt okay to land but wanted to let me know in case it got worse. I stood by ready to do so just in case. After landing we exited and made our way to the gate. I noticed on the ground that my night vision had suffered a little but was coming back. Approaching the gate my Captain said that in addition to the headache he felt a pain behind his right eye and requested that I called for paramedics to consult. I've been lasered before but never that aggressive and long. When police met the jet I shared with them the location off on my Jeppesen app as best I could tell. This is the 3rd strike I've had in the past 3 months. I really feel like we need some self evaluation guidance in our iPads or a protocol as these events are increasing. I've seen guidance and have read protocols from [other] airlines. As these events increase we need something.
Human Factors,We were given a heading of 190 to fly and then cleared direct ZZZZZ. Right about the time we were given the clearance we entered into icing condition and got a red EICAS warning telling us we had a master caution warning. This needed a checklist and during the checklist we did not remember to change back into NAV mode. When center checked in again with us they asked if we were direct ZZZZZ and at that point we changed into NAV mode direct to ZZZZZ. We were 10 degrees off when Center checked back in with us. When we received a master caution warning we got distracted and focused on fixing that current issue instead of focusing on getting back on course. PF Analysis: Making sure to multitask and make sure one pilot is fixing and the other pilot is flying before both pilots work on a solution.
Human Factors,After [the] engine run for number 1 bearing manifold O-Ring leak check; [I] noticed captive barrel nuts for spinner had dislodged and damaged several fan blades and engine liners. The engine was run without the spinner for the purpose of the leak check. [The] Aircraft Maintenance Manual called for spinner installation.
Aircraft,"During cruise flight at FL320; the R ENG OIL PRESS"" warning message displayed along with ""OIL Pressure"" indicating ""0 PSI."" Crew executed the procedures in the [appropriate] section of the Quick Reference Handbook. [The] crew shut down the right engine as directed by the Quick Reference Handbook; requested priority handling with ATC and landed in ZZZ without further incident."""
Human Factors,We were flying final approach Runway XX ZZZ. Aircraft X was flying stop and gos and touch and gos on the XY/XZ. We had cancelled IFR and were flying a visual backed up with the RNAV. Aircraft X continued to turn a normal left hand pattern and flew right in front of us at pattern altitude when we were on short final. We went around and completed an uneventful pattern and landed safely. There was a debate about how much clearance there was; we were nose high; the high wing never identified us but they believed we were never close; according to the PIC who spoke with them. It has always been customary to allow faster jet traffic to land by extending the pattern of slower smaller traffic; this CFI may not have been aware of this giving the lack of traffic at that Airport.
Aircraft,Approximately 10 minutes after reaching a cruising altitude of FL360; the cabin altitude warning went off. The cabin altitude reached 11;500 ft. We requested priority handling; began an immediate descent; and completed our Quick Reference Handbook procedures. The cabin altitude returned to normal when we reached FL200. We leveled off at FL200; cancelled the priority handling; and continued to our destination without further incident.
Procedure,I was training on radar east. Three aircraft were being vectored for the ILS XXR. Aircraft Y came on frequency about 50 miles northeast of ZZZ1. Trainee issued 6;000 feet and Aircraft Y was in a 6;600 feet MVA; but Aircraft Y was still high around 14000 ft. Trainee was applying anticipated separation and it seemed like it would work. Once I observed Aircraft Y through 7;000 feet; I told the trainee to stop Aircraft Y at 6;600 feet. Trainee transmitted to maintain 6;600 feet. as the Aircraft Y was at 6;600 feet. The pilot acknowledged; said they were descending through 6;600 feet already and asked if they should climb. The trainee said yes; climb maintain 6;600 feet. We observed Aircraft Y continue descent to 6;200 feet and then start the climb back up.As the OJT Instructor; I should have just keyed up and instructed the aircraft to maintain altitude instead of telling the trainee to do so. I wasted valuable seconds that could have kept them from going through the MVA. I also did not expect the pilot to advise they went through the altitude and then ask if they should climb. My expectation was that they would maintain the altitude or climb to it and again there were valuable seconds lost via transmissions. [I should] utilize 7;000 feet. instead of anticipating for aircraft that far out.
Aircraft,Approaching ZZZZ2 position ZZZZZ enroute to ZZZZ1; I was in the bunk and FOs (First Officer) Name and Name 1 were at the controls. They rang me and I came up front. They told me that they had seen a brief HYD PRESS DEM 1 and then HYD PRESS ENG 1 EICAS message which both showed only momentarily; then cleared themselves. We monitored the system via the synoptic and all looked normal. Shortly thereafter we got a HYD PRESS DEM 1 EICAS followed by a HYD PRESS ENG 1 EICAS which stayed illuminated. Following the 2 EICAS and ECL Checklist procedures in turn; we turned off Engine Driven Pump 1 and then turned the Eng 1 HYD Demand Pump to the ON position. At that point; the Demand Pump was feeding the system; which indicated it was full with approximately 3;000 PSI. It appeared that the HYD fluid temperature was 20 degrees higher than the other 3 engines so I initiated a conversation with Maintenance; Dispatch and the Duty Pilot. Maintenance relayed that just running the Demand Pump constantly wouldn't cause the fluid temperature to increase since it's physically the same kind of pump as the Engine Driven Pump. We further monitored the temperature; fluid levels; and pressures; and they all appeared to stabilize at normal levels. At this point; other than having ENG Driven Pump 1 turned off; everything indicated normal. Since we were almost on top of the ETP (Equal Time Point) and all current indications were that we had a good system except for the EDP (Engine Driven Pump); I opted to proceed to ZZZZ1.As we continued on; I monitored HYD SYS 1 fluid temperature and it reduced to 66°C; down from 72°C. I was convinced things would be fine with nothing more than a failed EDP. About 1 hour from ZZZZ1 at XA:07; I was in the left seat and FO Name 1 had gotten out of the seat for a physiological break. It was while I was alone in the seat that I got the HYD PRESS SYS 1 EICAS message. I checked the synoptic and saw that HYD SYS 1 pressure had dropped to 110 PSI; indicating a Demand Pump failure. Throughout this event; HYD Quantity stayed full.I got the rest of the crew up front and we ran the Emergency Checklist for HYD PRESS SYS 1. We checked over all the lost systems and noted those. We realized we would have to manually lower the landing gear and that the Inboard Trailing Edge Flaps would be slow to move in Secondary mode. We also noted that we would have no nose wheel of body gear steering and that we'd have to stop on the runway and get towed off. We checked the weather; ran the data and continued to ZZZZ1. As early as possible; we [requested priority handling] because I knew shutting down their primary runway would be an issue and I needed to give them as much advanced notice as possible.Beginning the descent; we had approximately 23;000 lb. of fuel so I opted to configure very early in order to get the manual gear extension completed and allow for the slow flap extension. Passing about 9;000 ft. and 230 KIAS; we manually lowered the gear. I wanted the slightly higher-than-normal speed to assist providing air-load to lower and lock the gear. I also slowed and lowered flaps to 10 passing about 6;000 ft. to give them plenty of time to get into position.That all went smoothly and we got vectors to ILS XXR at ZZZZ1. I accomplished what I felt was a smooth landing using 30 flaps and autobrakes 3. Since we know we'd have no #1 reverser; I brought all 4 reversers to idle and used 2 and 3 at max reverse. We came to a stop uneventfully and stayed straight ahead on the runway where we shut down awaiting a tow. When Maintenance looked at our airplane; he told me on the intercom that the gear doors were resting on the tires and that we couldn't tow. He was able to get them off the tires and we were able to continue the tow. After shutdown and looking at the gear doors Maintenance assured me that there had been no damage to either the gear doors or the tires. I'm still not sure how they could possibly have been resting on the tires when we were stationary but [did] not touch them during the landing. I related the same story to the [governing facility] through the Maintenance Representative's interpreting and was cleared to leave.[The cause was] apparent failure of both the ENG 1 Engine Driven Hydraulic Pump and the Engine 1 Demand Pump; [and] total loss of System 1 Hydraulic Pressure. [The] quantity remained full.
Human Factors,Release did not have an alternate on it for 5G NOTAM. As per the company policy we are supposed to add an alternate for 5G NOTAMs at destination. I missed the NOTAM in review the flight release for release to crew. Crew called for a new release for fuel uplift. On pass off that morning which happened coincidentally near the time of departure; the oncoming dispatcher caught this. I ACARS the crew; crew called; and we agreed to amend the flight planned instead of a new release. I amended the flight release for an alternate of ZZZ1; sent weather; and sent NOTAMS. Flight launched and terminated without incident. This all happened before block out. I scanned through the NOTAMs and did not see the 5G NOTAM. The 5G NOTAM to Runway XXR was there. I had thought ZZZ2 was not a 5G NOTAM airport.First; better diligence on my part in checking and noticing 5G NOTAMs that will affect added alternates and fuel. Secondly; I have reviewed the Alternate Method of Compliance 5G alert again and will be sure to include ALTNs when needed. Third; can we have a monthly update on what is happening between the airlines; FAA; and our internal department. The more clear communication on updates to this we the better. Why are we continuing to added alternate for VFR weather at destination?
Human Factors,While descending on the Robuc3 RNAV Arrival into BOS we were instructed by ATC to level off at 13;000 ft. due to small GA traffic. We identified the traffic on TCAS and began to level. Within 100 ft. of leveling off we were given a TCAS RA to level off followed by a RA to climb. At that point we made visual contact with a small twin engine aircraft approximately 200 ft. below our nose. We immediately climbed until we were clear of the conflict and notified ATC. The rest of the flight was without incident. I believe the cause was due to ATC giving us the same altitude as a much slower aircraft.
Human Factors,At 600 feet AGL on approach; the FA (Flight Attendant) called the cockpit to inform us there was smoke pouring into the cabin and the passengers were panicked. Based on her description; I determined it was not smoke; but excess PACK condensation. I informed her of this. This was a high-distraction event; in extremely windy conditions. The CA (Captain) PF (Pilot Flying) was working his butt off. We continued the approach and landed without incident. On the ground I made a PA; explaining the condensation to the passengers. Prior to boarding the outbound flight; I instructed the gate agent to make a gate PA explaining the fog in the aircraft was due to air conditioning condensation and perfectly normal in ZZZ; this time of year.I have had this happen before. There are 3 causes: 1. Whether or not this is a malfunction; has been debated the entire XX years I have been flying CRJ variants. The fact is the PACKS are not being maintained at an optimal level. The only crew solution is to raise the PACK temperature; which is not an option on a CRJ200 in the summer; in the south. 2. FAs are not adequately trained on how to tell the difference between smoke and PACK condensation. The FA stated it was mentioned in training; but that there was no visual aid. There should also be training on PA announcements the FA could make in order to calm panicked passengers. The FA mentioned this was her first summer as an FA. 3. Captains need to brief FAs on the possibility of this occurring when flying in hot and humid conditions on takeoff and approach. In this case; it was a surprise for all; because we departed a cool dry ZZZ1 with no cabin fog and landed in a hot humid ZZZ; with lots of cabin fog.
Aircraft,During initial climb; flight attendants reported an odor from the cabin. Both front and aft Flight Attendants reported odor. It was reported as an electrical odor. The First Officer was Pilot Flying and I was Pilot Monitoring. I requested priority handling with a brief description of Electrical Odor in cabin. We were immediately turned back to field. We landed overweight. Upon landing the flight attendants said the odor had dissipated and we taxied under our own power to the Gate.
Aircraft,Departure; climb; enroute and most of the descent phases of flight were normal. Near the bottom of descent; two deviations for large thunderstorms near the bottom of the STAR and the instrument approach IAF were required. As the Pilot Flying; after slowing to configure; I called 'Gear down; Flaps 20; Before Landing checklist'. After verifying that the speedbrake was armed; the Pilot Monitoring paused waiting for the gear down; three green callout. The pause took longer than normal and caused me to look at the landing gear. I saw the handle down; a green nose gear light and a green right main gear light. This occurred passing approximately 2400 ft. AGL. I continued the approach on localizer and glideslope. I did a cockpit lights test; no green light in the left main. My FO (First Officer) tapped the left gear indicator with no effect. We did not have a GEAR DISAGREE light; so the thought of the problem being a sensor or light bulb crossed my mind. I elected to have the PM (Pilot Monitoring) raise the gear until it was up and locked; then called GEAR DOWN again. Our gear indications did not change. Now passing 1000 [ft.] AGL and VMC; I elected to go around with the gear handle down. The missed approach procedure for Runway XXR involves several points and multiple speed restrictions. Additionally; there was a large thunderstorm over the missed approach holding fix. and a storm long and left of the field; moving our direction. ZZZZ1 being a SPL-QLFY-ARPT; I elected to climb to the MSA for our direction of flight in relation to the airport and coordinate alternate holding instructions with ATC in order to work the problem. At that time; I requested priority handling with ATC. I then asked the FO to get the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) out. After reviewing all of the options in the Landing Gear section of the QRH; but having no GEAR DISAGREE EICAS (Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System) message; I felt the reviewing the GEAR DISAGREE Checklist for options; while remaining on the magenta line; approaching holding was the best course of action. After discussing which checklist to run; I decided to run the GEAR DISAGREE Checklist down to alternate gear extend and coordinate a low pass with ZZZZ1 Tower for a visual inspection by any available aircraft; Fire/Rescue or Tower personnel. Tower was helpful with the plan. After the low pass; between 100 [to] 200 ft.; I asked for an observation of whether our left main gear was down or not. We received a very definitive 'negative; your left gear is not down' from what sounded like the Tower and what sounded to us like another aircraft waiting to takeoff. Given our remaining fuel; weather and terrain; I elected to complete the GEAR DISAGREE Checklist; which leads the crew to plan to land on available gear. After completing the GEAR DISAGREE Checklist and discussing the plan inter cockpit; we shared the plan with ATC. We commenced the ILS (Y) to Runway XXR; touchdown was fairly smooth and on centerline. We were prepared for a left side drop; but one did not occur. I brought the airplane to a complete stop on the runway. After having ZZZZ1 Fire/Rescue and [Company] aircraft MX (Maintenance) look over the aircraft and the left landing gear specifically; I elected to have the gear pinned and be towed to the ramp.[The causes of this situation were] incongruent landing gear indications without an associated EICAS in an extreme weather; terrain and foreign ATC situation. Possible [solution would be] adding a checklist in the Landing Gear section that addresses Gear Handle Down with Gear Down Light(s) not illuminated.
Aircraft,Shortly after initial climb following departure from ZZZZ; we received a master caution for a Hydraulic Failure Alert.  I was pilot flying so the Captain pulled up the Hydraulic synoptic and stated we had lost all Hydraulic 1 fluid.  He read through the Quick Reference Handbook and after discussing the options between ourselves (and with the 777 jump seater) we decided to return to ZZZZ.  At this point we decided it would be safer for the Captain to take the role of Pilot Flying and I took over Pilot Monitoring. During configuration for the approach; on our first attempt; we received a slat disagree alert with accompanying aircraft deviation to the left.  The Captain turned off autopilot and was was able to compensate with aileron Neil slats were retracted per the Quick Reference Handbook.  We then requested to enter a hold at the IAF for the approach at 3;000 ft. again to review the Quick Reference Handbook further.  After reviewing implications of a return landing from the Quick Reference Handbook; we briefed and commenced a Runway XX return approach.  However; when extending the flaps to Runway XX; they did not extend past 22 and we received a flap disagree alert.  We discontinued the approach and went back out to the missed approach holding position to re-evaluate and reference the Quick Reference Handbook again. Once in holding again; we received updated winds from Tower and elected to change to Runway YY to have more favorable winds for landing. Rwy YY loc is a 3.5 deg glide slope but was discussed and determined to be favorable to a tailwind given high landing speeds of a Runway XX return to landing.  On our second approach attempt; the flaps stuck at 22 degrees again and we became high on the approach so we discontinued again and took vectors back around for the localizer YY approach again.  On this third approach we configured earlier; hoping having the gear down might help flaps fully deploy; and the flaps were able to reach Runway XX after landing gear was extended and with more time. The captain flew an outstanding approach and flair to land and we landed uneventfully.  We taxied to the end and turned clear of the runway into a run-up area where we waited for our brakes to cool and a tug to hook up and tow us back to the ramp. Suggestion - more thorough monitoring of hydraulic system components during inspections and maintenance performed.
Procedure,I was working the CIC (Controller in Charge) position in Area X; when I received a call from ZZZ TMU (Traffic Management Unit) manager Name. She informed me that Aircraft X; still on the ground in ZZZ; was going to depart into X Sector's airspace for ZZZ on Jet way routing. She said he wouldn't be able to fly that routing and would need to be issued a re-route on alternate route. I asked her why; if the aircraft was still on the ground; why ZZZ Tower couldn't issue the route; to which she responded 'BECAUSE HE'S NUMBER ONE FOR TAKEOFF' and hung up.Considering the request would place the aircraft in Area Y; I walked over and told Name 1; the Area Y CIC to coordinate with the Sector Y controller to effect the change. The pilot subsequently queried the controller why he was being issued the re-route.When she called the TMU supervisor; she said the re-route was due to weather 'in Florida'. IN FLORIDA.Asking controllers to do things that are contrary to our safety-based mission is a reoccurring situation with this particular individual.In this case; we had weather; deviations; turbulence; and icing in and around ZZZ on all departure routes. The SAFEST place to issue an aircraft a re-route is when it is on the ground; not moving. In fact; we even spent a lot of money at ZZZ constructing a midfield taxiway to provide controllers with the flexibility to move aircraft in and around active runways safely in situation *just like this*.Instead; we've made it a routine habit to launch aircraft and ask pilots to increase cockpit workload and distraction by adding unnecessary heads-down time to re-program Flight Management Systems to accommodate ineffective TMU systems; restrictions; and coordination. This also creates the need for the pilots to re-calculate fuel (again; something that should be done on the ground if at all possible) and deprive them of the opportunity to load addition fuel on the aircraft if they deem it necessary because of the new route.
Weather,On Date around XA:25 local; I was training a D-side. I told the D-side to back up and let me take over due to the volume of traffic. We were told by our FLM to SLOW ALL traffic into Jacksonville Center. I told the R-side and we began to slow each aircraft back. Four minutes later; J34 sector called to tell us they were not taking any more aircraft and to hold them all. J33 and J50 sectors in ZJX were soon to follow. The R-side had to issue 13 different present position holds while working normal traffic in between. Aircraft X was given holding instructions at FL330. Aircraft Y was southbound over the ATL VOR and in line to get their holding instructions. The R-side and myself were busy with other aircraft when conflict alert went off between the two aircraft. The R-side issued immediate turns to both aircraft to prevent a serious incident; but they did end up losing standard separation at 4.48 miles and the same altitude. With Jacksonville Center shutting us off on all traffic going southbound; I'm surprised this was the only loss of separation that happened. Neither J33 or J34 had aircraft holding in their sectors at the time. This has become a systemic problem with both Traffic Management and Jacksonville Center. I recommend that the NAS start treating every major airport in Florida as they do Chicago/New York/Atlanta arrivals in terms of spacing off the ground. The lack of controlling expertise in ZJX this summer; if this continues; will likely lead to more of these situations or worse.
Human Factors,I put Aircraft X in position after a departure and with Aircraft Y on final. I cleared Aircraft X for an expedited take off with what I considered sufficient time and spacing with Aircraft Y on final and the departing aircraft did not start their departure roll as expected. I then reiterated to Aircraft X to expedite their departure and their company was within a mile. Aircraft Y initiated a go around on their own outside of a half mile as Aircraft X was already on departure roll and a critical stage of flight. I subsequently asked the pilot of Aircraft Y the reason for go around and they indicated that they thought it was too close to the departure for their comfort. I felt that I would have had adequate runway separation if the pilot would not have initiated the go around considering the arriving aircraft slowing down and the departure accelerating. I take this event as a learning lesson and contribute expectancy bias to be the main contributing factor on my part as the controller. I will implement more consideration for spacing and timing and aircraft characteristics and performance.
Human Factors,After flight landed research went into where a missing DG shipment was. Security camera TV found the shipment being loaded on Aircraft Y.  Aircraft X does not accept radio active DG.
Aircraft,Climbing out from ZZZ we experienced an Engine 2 Anti Ice failure. We experienced icing in the climb out and requested higher to exit the icing when presented with the E2 Anti Ice fail. The first flight of the day checks showed no signs of the icing systems not working properly prior to takeoff. The ice system failed nearly immediately after entering icing conditions. We were cleared to climb and ATC requested a top for our climb; this was an ongoing request in search for skies free of icing. As we continued with the flight; we worked with ATC for higher to remain clear of icing conditions. I was the Pilot Flying and assigned the First Officer to troubleshoot. We ran the Quick Reference Handbook and verified that the E2 Anti Ice system had failed. On confirmation of the failure after the completion of troubleshooting via the Quick Reference Handbook; we confirmed with ATC our requirements and worked with dispatch. We chose to continue to ZZZ1 due to better weather and the ability to remain clear of icing conditions. This was first the safest option; following that being the safest option it did not create any undue burden to the passengers or operation. ATC worked with us to remain clear of clouds/icing and worked to give us a block altitude for cruise and pilot's discretion for descents. We were able to remain clear of icing conditions as we continued to our destination of ZZZ1. ATC did an amazing job working with us. We had minor altitude deviations remaining clear of clouds.  ATC did assign a block altitude as well to assist with keeping us clear of all icing conditions. ATC had no issue with our altitude variation with our requirement(s) to remain clear of icing for the icing system failure. I am unsure of the greatest difference in altitude vs assignment but none were gross or requiring comment from ATC. Potentially request and be granted block altitudes earlier in the process of the [priority]. Likelihood is not strong but worth considering if in the same event in the future.
Aircraft,Climbing through roughly 17;000 ft. the Captain and I noticed a smell similar to a hot oven. It was not strong and we did not feel any adverse effects. The Captain called to the back and they confirmed nothing was in the oven and that they smelled it as well. As we leveled at 22;000 the smell dissipated and we assumed it was transitory. Upon final descent (7;000 on the downwind) into ZZZ we faintly smelled it again for a very brief period but it went away just as quickly. Once we parked we conferred with the flight attendants who informed us that the smell was worse in the back. Upon landing; we were evaluated by paramedics. I had a headache; dry metallic mouth; and all my vitals were normal. The smell itself did not cause alarm. It was not overwhelming; with no reduction in visibility; and no adverse effects inflight.
Aircraft,After block in at ZZZ the Lead Flight Attendant came up to the Flight Deck and said we had a pretty strong Odor coming from the Forward Gallery area that smelled like jet fuel. She said the Odor began just before we lowered the landing gear on approach into ZZZ and dissipated as we were taxiing to the gate. Both Flight Attendants described the order as being 'Strong and a bit irritating'. Maintenance Control was then notified; and logbook entry was made as well as a Fume/Odor report. A mechanic was quick to meet us at the gate and was briefed.
Airport,Pushed back from Gate XX in MKE at XA:59 in nighttime conditions. Received clearance from Ground Control to taxi to the West Deice Pad via Taxiways B and V. Confirmed the clearance on the 10-9 (airport diagram) and taxied towards Taxiway B. The Company 10-9 page erroneously depicts Taxiway B as a STRAIGHT taxiway delineating the edge of the ramp. In actuality; the ramp has a rectangular cutout area that extends past Taxiway B. Upon approaching the edge of the ramp; we turned to join what we thought was Taxiway B but found ourselves turning into the end of the cutout and onto the snow-covered; grassy area at the edge of the ramp. The aircraft came to a gentle stop. Upon realizing we had departed the ramp area; we contacted MKE Operations and Maintenance Personnel. The aircraft gear pins were inserted. After conferring with Company Ground Operations; Maintenance Control; Dispatch; and MKE Airport Operations; it became clear that the best course of action would be to deplane the Passengers before attempting to reposition the aircraft. We briefed the Cabin Crew and Passengers in-person from the cabin.To ensure a safe deplaning on an otherwise slippery; ice-covered ramp; gravel/sand was placed on the ramp along the aft footprint of the aircraft. Flight Attendants provided a water service to the Passengers while we awaited the arrival of the 'TSA-cleared' buses. The Passengers were deplaned by the Flight Attendants in a very orderly fashion; three rows at a time; from the aft entry door via airstairs and taken via buses to the terminal. The checked bags were unloaded. The aircraft was defueled; repositioned to a terminal gate; and placed back into service. No injuries or aircraft damage were reported during the event.MKE Airport Operations informed us that plans were in the works to mark off the ramp area in question with 'xxx' markings and place lights to better delineate the irregular taxiway boundary. An update to the MKE 10-9 chart would help provide better situational awareness during taxi operations particularly during periods of inclement weather and/or in the presence of ground clutter.
Aircraft,Upon reaching cruise flight; after sequencing through the aircraft systems; the Green Hydraulic System quantity was noticeably lower than it normally is. Sent a maintenance message code requesting hydraulic servicing upon arrival in ZZZ. Just prior to starting descent; we received a HYD G RSVR LO LVL ECAM momentarily. It repeated and extinguished multiple times in the next 30-60 seconds; then illuminated steadily. Ran the QRH procedure; [requested priority handling]; notified the FAs and passengers; and prepped the cabin for an evacuation. Contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control through AIRINC. Prepared for a manual gear extension on approach but ultimately did not have to as the gear extended normally with enough residual hydraulic fluid in the system. Normal landing and clearing of the runway. Coordinated with station Operations to have the aircraft towed into the gate.
Aircraft,Refused aircraft due to four logbook entries in previous five days for Pack Reg Fault. System was reset and signed off twice as good to go; faulted again and was placed on MEL and cleared; faulted again and was cleared via part replacement. Maintenance Control stated wrong part was most likely replaced. Fault was present when I arrived at aircraft (after part was replaced). Maintenance Tech reset system; fault occurred again. Maintenance Supervisor wanted to MEL system again. Strongly suggest company comply with the spirit and intent of the MEL program and stop using it as a way to simply ensure on time performance and completion factor.
Aircraft,Normal takeoff from Runway XXR on a 270 heading. During climbout while Captain was flying pilot through approximately 8000 ft with the autopilot off at 250 kts I noticed the Master Caution illuminate. On the overhead panel I saw MACH TRIM FAIL light was illuminated. Captain called 'my aircraft' while I opened the QRH. The procedure only says to fly below 280 Kts/.82. ATC then asked us to accelerate to 300 kts. I told them 280 was as fast as we could do and that we were troubleshooting a flight control malfunction. CA (Captain) then tried to engage the autopilot but CMD A or CMD B would not take. After climbing through 12;000 feet the jump seater advised that the mach trim fail light had extinguished. The Captain was then able to engage the autopilot. After passing approx; 18;000 [ft.] the mach trim fail light returned as we continued the climb with the autopilot on and the autopilot began to capture FL240; the CA noticed the aircraft was potentially going to continue through FL240 and then decided to disconnect the autopilot. He described feeling a lot of forward control pressure for the level off and what he described as an abnormal amount of nose up trim was required. At that point we decided to return to ZZZ1 based on the abnormal trim situation he described to me. CA then gave me the aircraft and radios while he advised the FA's (Flight Attendants); Dispatch; and passenger while also running the non routine landing checklist and overweight landing checklist. ATC asked if we needed any assistance; I relayed the message to the CA and he advised me that we would not need any assistance and I advised ATC. We continued and set up for an overweight landing. On final the Captain took the aircraft back for the landing which had a touchdown that was less than 100ft/min. The 280kts/.82 restriction per the QRH was never exceeded and the autopilot was never re-engaged.I'm unaware of any other factors that may have contributed to this event.
Aircraft,On initial climb out passing 12;000 ft. cabin pressurization began to run away. The pressurization page came up and we observed 4;000 FPM. We immediately stopped our climb at 13;000 ft. When the plane leveled off and the power came back the cabin altitude and vertical speed stabilized. We had no ECAMs or warning or cautions. We asked to descend to 12;000 ft. Cabin altitude was operating normally. We asked to climb to 15;000 ft and when the power came up and we began to climb the same happened.We immediately ask for a descent to 10;000 ft. Again the cabin altitude and the rate of climb/descent was normal. We elected to [request priority handling] asked to hold at 10;000 ft. to burn fuel so as not to have an overweight landing. The cabin altitude stayed at 900 ft. during the hold. On descent for the approach the jump seaters noticed the cabin alt go into a slight climb for a few minutes than return to normal. [We had an] uneventful landing. [The problem was] high pressure air and pressurization computers malfunctioning [due to it being an] older aircraft. Some of the aircraft are old. Mechanical malfunctions will occur although in my years with the Airline they are very rare.
Aircraft,Descending from 10;000 to 6;000; ATC instructed us to slow to 210 kt. The Captain selected LVL CHG and tried to set the speed with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP (Mode Control Panel). He then noted that the airspeed would not change with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP. All three airspeed indicators matched so we knew it was not airspeed unreliable. We tried different vertical modes and turned the autothrottle off and back on and still could not change the speed with the IAS/MACH knob on the MCP. We finally decided to [request priority handling] as a precaution and turned off the autopilot and autothrottles and continued the approach. We landed without incident. At touchdown the MCP speed indicated 193 kt. but aircraft speed was at VREF+5. [I suggest to] maintain aircraft.
Human Factors,After receiving clearance to taxi from taxiway N and de-ice spot 1 at ZZZ ramp and commencing taxi a vendor in a truck drove in front of us; causing us to stop. He drove right across the beginning of active taxiway and cut us off. The truck was white with pictures of vending machines on it. Ramp Tower notified. Vendor cutting across active taxi lane and not giving way to taxiing aircraft.
Procedure,Incorrect loading of inaccessible dangerous goods (IDG) on top of accessible dangerous goods (ADG). IAW (In Accordance With) flight operations procedures this is not permitted for aircrew acceptance of ADG during inspection. We were assured by the DG specialists this was permissible. There seems to be a disconnect between DG specialists and aircrew procedures. Item was relocated to comply with flight operations procedures guidance but cause a delay in departure. Cause - Incorrect loading of IDG on top of ADG.
Aircraft,Aircraft X; Date XA:17. On approach into ZZZZ at approximately 10;700 ft. MSL; after putting the landing gear down; we only got green nose gear and a green right main gear lights. We accomplished a go around and began to run the QRH. After running the QRH; we had the same indications. We elected to do a low pass over the Runway at approximately 100 ft. Tower and a nearby aircraft verbalized that it appeared that the left main gear was not down and locked. After the low pass; we completed the QRH; landed on the known landing gear (nose and right main). Left landing gear held on landing; stopped on the Runway and had Maintenance tow us back to the Ramp. [Priority handling was requested].
Ambiguous,Climbing out over FTW Airport area on the HRPR3 SID at approximately 12000 ft.; got a Flashing RA in HUD (radio altimeter fail) as well on Primary Flight Display on Captain side (#1). Lasted about 30 seconds solid. First Officer did not notice on his side (#2) on aircraft. Possible 5G interference or some other interference. No other aircraft appeared above or below. Radio Altimeter operated normally on arrival to ZZZ.
Human Factors,I noticed a pallet of DG in the cargo area which raised my awareness since I mostly fly days and don't carry a lot of DG. In the past a pallet of DG was pretty unusual. I tend to use the job aid because of my infrequent DG inspections. When it came time to inspect it I opened the job aid to answer my question on when a pallet was allowed. Under Number 1 it stated three circumstances and it appeared we didn't comply with any of them. I did a conversion from KG to LBS after mentioning to the Captain I didn't know the conversion; he stated a rough conversion. The amount they had was well below the 'heavyweight' allowance. I told the Agent it was probably an issue and asked the Captain if he wanted me to call the Supervisor to back us up on the rules. The Supervisor stated we were correct. We asked if they had a DG container to which they stated 'no'. We subsequently asked for the DG to be removed because it didn't pass the rules of inspection. The Agent understood our issue and removed the pallet.
Aircraft,Departing XXR ZZZ I was the pilot flying. Name called positive rate and I responded with gear up; lights in; Yaw Damper on; climb check to the line. Name attempted to select the landing gear handle to the up position and was unable to. We decided to ask ZZZ Tower to come back to land XXR and they gave us right pattern XXR. Midfield downwind we noticed the landing gear down lock was audible (clicking). We continued the visual approach and landed normally.
Human Factors,On Date I was assigned to work the inbound of Aircraft X; coming from ZZZ1. I was the Crew Chief for Tow [Tug] 2; which included myself and four other crew members. I had logged in my ramp link to look up the offload for Aircraft X; while revising the offload; I had notice we had bags in the aft compartment only; nothing in the fwd compartment. The summary on the ramp link reported that I had bags in the A1 and one piece in the AB; at anytime did it ever mentioned anything about a DG (Dangerous Good). I had a brief huddle with the crew before the inbound flight had arrive; I designated each person a role. Name was the person inside the aft compartment; on various occasions I had mentioned to them that there was something showing up in the AB compartment on my ramp link; so I instructed them to please check the AB bulk area. Name confirmed that they had looked into the AB bulk compartment; not once but twice and in both occasions said that there was nothing in the AB bulk area. I realized the event had occurred the following day when a Manager had come over to me and explained to me what had happened and wanted to do a Q&A with me and the rest of the crew.I believe this occurred because of poor load planning; the DG piece was only 11 pounds. There was absolutely no need to place this in the AB Bulk area; an area which had no proper lighting; which may cause poor visibility; an area which the netting is covered; in where every other part of the aircraft the netting's are see through as well. The action that was taken after the Q&A; Me and Name were put on a coaching because management stated that we failed to alert them that there was no DG in the AB bulk area although it was showing in the ramp link. My suggestion is take out the solid curtains and replace them with netting.
Human Factors,On Date at approximately XA39 we departed from the Hospital located next door to ZZZ airport in a EMS helicopter.I made an initial radio call and heard and seen no traffic in the pattern. A crew member aboard called out traffic at 10 to 11 o'clock at a low altitude; we were showing around 1500 ft. and climbing. The traffic appeared to be very low only a few hundred ft. above the ground and appeared to be circling over some houses. I made another radio call stating our altitude; intended flight path; and intended landing location; and still heard no radio traffic reply.As we were continuing our climb up to 3500 ft. and our desired heading; the airplane then rolled out of his turn; starting climbing to match our altitude and then turned at our 9 o'clock to a heading that would be direct to the left side of the helicopter. Not knowing his intentions and the climb rate he was ascending; I stopped my climb and leveled out at 2500 ft. The airplane then passed directly underneath our helicopter at approximately 200 ft. below according to my onboard traffic avoidance system. I thought perhaps the airplane had not seen us and was not monitoring the frequency or did not have a radio. My crew member then stated the aircraft had passed so close as he flew under us that he could see his face and made eye contact with the pilot of the airplane.We then started our climb again and the airplane turned his course to match ours; and then leveled off directly under the helicopter with his altitudes varying from 100 ft. to 300 ft. below us. Not knowing his intentions I continued to climb to try to create more vertical separation but the airplane continued to change his altitude to maintain around 200 ft. below us. I then started to change my direction by 10 degrees to the right but then the airplane changed his direction to match still flying directly under the aircraft and still keeping around 200 to 300 ft. below us. I then turned to left; again trying to get this airplane out from under us; but again he changed direction to match. I made several calls on the radio but did not receive any replies.The airplane then turned slight to move to our 5:00 position still at the same altitudes and remained there for approximately 1 minute; then he changed course to move his position to our 7:00; all this time he was probably less than 1/2 mile in separation from us horizontally and during these position changes was now matching our altitude again. The aircraft then started a slow turn to the left and finally was moving away from us. The aircraft was now off our 10 o'clock position and flying very low in mountainous terrain. A couple of minutes later as I was on final; I heard him make a radio call that he was entering a left downwind for Runway XX at ZZZ1.My first thought as this situation happened was that the pilot didn't see us. It became clear though after the first near miss that the airplane pilot had a visual on us and apparently thought perhaps it would be funny to keep doing this. This whole occurrence lasted approximately 8 to 10 minutes. The pilot's actions were very dangerous and reckless. If I had not had two crew members to keep eyes on the airplane when he was not directly below me; or if I had not had a traffic avoidance system; this situation could have turned very bad. I could have been responding to a scene request and been landing in any of the fields below us in which case I could have been making altitude and heading changes that would have been unexpected by the airplane. I hope this pilot is contacted and at least educated of the dangers of his actions.
Ambiguous,We were descending in VMC via the HYDRR 1 Arrival into PHX for Runway 25R. At FL 250 about 12 miles west of the SPINK intersection the aircraft shuddered then rolled left rapidly and the nose yawed. I immediately grasped the yoke and not sure if I turned off the autopilot or if it disengaged; but I rolled the aircraft back to level flight. I was looking outside and saw the roll coming back through 10 degrees; I asked the F/O if he saw how far left we banked. He said he thought 20 degrees. I called back to see if the F/A's were ok. They said three of them were in the aft galley and had been tossed around and the contents of the aft galley bins had been thrown on the floor. Cans; drinks and ice. One F/A was in the aisle and said she had been able to brace against a seat. No one reported any injuries at this time. We asked ATC what we were following and they reported a (other carrier) aircraft. I noted the wind at altitude was 280/20 which was a direct tailwind to our track. As we continued we got occasional buffeting which may have been wake related. As we got in the terminal area; ATC issued a visual and I attempted to remain above the A330's flight path on final. I even slowed more to allow more distance between us. I flew one dot high on the ILS glideslope yet at 800 ft AGL; we encountered another minor roll event. Aircraft remained controllable and we continued normally. On the ground; post flight; I spoke with all four F/A's; again asking if they had any injuries. They said just sore and possible bruising from being tossed against the aft galley but did not say they were injured.While we were 12 miles in trail; we had no idea we were following a heavy. Perhaps more in trail spacing for heavy and 737 types.
Ambiguous,Due to the 5G interference at JAX they are not authorized to allow Cat 2 or 3 approaches. Weather dropped to 1/4 SM visibility and was un-forecasted. Had to divert to ZZZ for fuel and allow the visibility to rise at JAX. Returned to JAX after re-fueled.
Human Factors,On short final during a visual approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ we were alerted by a GPWS audible annunciation of 'Too Low; Flaps' at approximately 200 ft. AGL. I was hand flying the aircraft at the time and stated to the First Officer; 'We are at flaps 30; right? He took a look and said no; we're at 25; and simultaneously moved the flap lever to the 30 degree position. We proceeded to complete the approach and landing uneventfully.We were flying a 737 MAX; which is rare for me; and I initially wasn't sure if I wanted to set up the flight instrument displays so that the engine instruments and flaps display were on my Multi-function Flight Display or the First Officer's. I opted to have them on the First Officer's side and have a larger map display on my side. This put the flap display further from my view. We had completed the before landing checklist at approximately 2;000 ft. AGL; and both of us thought we had verified flaps at 30 degrees; but apparently we were still at 25. The First Officer mentioned he might have gone to flaps 10 when I called for 15; and then was behind by one notch for each subsequent call. I believe when I called for flaps 30; the lever was moved from 15 to 25; and regrettably; neither of us caught the discrepancy. The approach remained stable throughout the incident. In retrospect; upon receiving the alert; we should have executed a go-around. This would have prevented us from making a configuration change below the standard 1;000 approach criteria. In the future; I'll also be more careful to take a close look at the flap indication for each setting; and set up the Multi-function Flight Display so that when I'm the flying pilot on the MAX; I'll keep the gauges displayed closer to me to facilitate an accurate reading.
Ambiguous,IMC; Pilot in Command; Pilot Flying [on] arrival; getting vectors for Runway XX; weather 800/3 WIND 320/16G26; Altimeter 999 MB. 5000 ft.; flaps 5; 200 KTS. ATC says ' cleared direct ZZZZZ; descend 3000 ft. cleared RNAV XX approach. Transition Level is 4500 ft. being close in to ZZZZZ on autopilot; Pilot Flying wanted FLCH to 3000 quickly so as to engage LVSAFE process ASAP. When prompted Altimeters; at Transition Level of 4500; by the time all altimeters set going from STD to 999 MB instantly lost approximately 800 ft.; do to transiting to LOW pressure aircraft was slightly below 3000 Autopilot didn't capture altitude selected above it. Auto throttles did not wake up slowed to 180 KTS; until recovery had to be initiated manually at 2740 with power and autopilot disconnected. Autopilot was re-selected at 3000 ft. and the approach was accomplished uneventfully. A safety representative called me and was asked to file company report.The Transition Level was known to the crew and we were prepared for the transition. What was not prepared for the instant loss of 1000 due to the very low altimeter setting; in a good descent rate put the aircraft below the selected altitude. The autopilot did not capture; an attempt on the MCP was made to change pitch mode and reacquire the selected altitude of 3000; and no autopilot response was met with a manual pilot intervention at 2740. All taken place after 10 hour all-nighter; IMC; and both pilots less than 100 hours in type; however familiar with ZZZZ in other Aircraft and seats. I recommend a published company procedure for this eventuality and crew awareness brief; so as to not be surprised by it. Lesser experienced crews might have gotten into real trouble. An easy to read conversion chart on altitude differences from flight ops on the briefing guide might be in order.
Human Factors,On approach into ZZZ the controller was trying to keep us in tight because of traffic to follow. We were cleared the visual on a 90 intercept just outside the FAF; we were told not to widen our approach. Upon being cleared for the approach the aircraft was being configured. I was heads down during the configuration change. I looked up and noticed that we were descending below FAF altitude and I quickly check the chart to verify that; then proceeded to inform the Captain of the altitude in which he immediately arrested the descent until glide path intercept. We were alerted by ATC of a low altitude alert. We completed the rest of the approach with no further issues. ATC pressures and nighttime. We should not have accepted the visual approach at night on a 90 degree intercept.
Aircraft,5 minutes after established in cruise; FA (Flight Attendant) 1 reported an electrical smell in the cabin. I transferred PF (Pilot Flying) duties to the FO (First Officer); and began the QRC/QRH. The FA1 told me she gathered 2 PBE's and 2 fire extinguishers; and started a thorough search for the smell source. Coincidentally; the FO/PF told me immediately after the FA1 reported the smell; that the air conditioning packs were running significantly warmer than normal and that he reduced the pack temps resulting in a rapid decrease in supply duct temperature. Less than 1 minute after reporting the smell/supply duct temp reduction; the FA1 reported a rapid reduction in the smell. The source was obvious and extinguished quickly. No injuries were reported for the crew/passengers. After consultation with Dispatch and Maintenance Control the flight was continued.Overheated pack.Cleaner air conditioning packs.
Aircraft,At top of descent the crew received an ECAM message: AIR ENG 2 BLEED LEAK. The crew preformed the ECAM procedure and secured the number 2 bleed. Shortly after we noticed the cabin pressurization begin to climb and exceed 10;000 ft. Crew performed the immediate descent procedure to 10;000 ft. Crew requested priority handling and landed safely. This was a system failure. Followed procedures.
Aircraft,[We were] in flight diversion; with return to ZZZZ after SATCOM consultation with Dispatcher; Duty Officer; and Maintenance Control. Safety report [is] required for diversion; but attempted to file this report as it covers both. But; I was unable to file it on my iPad as each time I came to a date pop-up field; the pop-up would immediately disappear and I was unable to enter any pop-up fields manually. This has to be fixed. It's essential to be able to file a [report] off our iPads and the ability to do so should be investigated. I'm home and doing this off my desktop. This was my maintenance write-up and is self-explanatory: Approximately takeoff plus 1 hour; received a Level 1 AIR SYS 2 OFF alert. Noted a red MANF (Manifold) light on overhead panel for Air System 2 and a red flow line for the tail anti-ice on air synoptic page. Within seconds; the air flow line for System 2 also turned red. About 10 seconds later; noted red Pack Number 1 symbol on air synoptic; then received a Level 1 AIR SYS 1 OFF alert and noted a red MANF light for Air System 1 on overhead air panel. Shortly thereafter; received a Level 1 SEL AIR SYS MAN alert; followed QRH and selected Air System to manual. After about 9 minutes; red Pack System 1 returned to normal; red tail anti-ice flow line disappeared; and red MANF Number 1 System extinguished. Red flow line for System 2 remained on air synoptic. About 1 minute later; that red flow line on System 2 synoptic returned to normal and red MANF Air System 2 extinguished. Remained in AIR SYS MANUAL with Air Systems 1 and 2 off for remainder of flight. Conferenced SATCOM with Dispatch; Duty Officer; and Maintenance; and returned to ZZZZ.Maintenance solution to write-up: During inspection of Center Cargo Jet Pump Shut-off Valve; found leaks at tee fitting of the shut-off valve. Re-tighten tee fitting per AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) 21-XX-XX-X; no more leaks. Also performed decay test with APU per AMM 36-YY-YY-Y. Found satisfactory. Aircraft OK for service.The puzzling thing about this was both Air Systems 1 and 2 shut off with no QRH procedure to cover both systems affected. Even with conference call; we were unable to figure out the common reason for both systems to be affected. Returned to ZZZZ as we all felt that if the third and last air system went out; we would be in a difficult situation over ZZZZ with limited options.
Human Factors,On Aircraft X from ZZZ to LGA on Date we were told by LGA Tower that they got a low altitude alert on our flight while on the Park Visual Runway 31. We complied with all the step down altitudes and were following the snow flake and at no time were lower than the charted altitudes and advisory glide path information. Still don't know what triggered this radio call from Tower; we were VMC and in safe position with excellent visibility at all times. Don't know; maybe putting the charted altitudes in on the Park Visual 31 approach gave erroneous snow flake and glide path information.
Aircraft,The aircraft departed ZZZ to ZZZZ on time. Approximately 5 minutes in to the flight; I received a call from the Captain informing me they had lost center hydraulic pressure and needed to speak to Maintenance and the Chief Pilot. I asked if they had requested priority handling and they stated that they had. I then conferences the call with maintenance. The captain stated they had lost hydraulics in the center system; and were checking to see if there was anything else they could do besides the checklist items. Maintenance informed them there were no additional items they could perform. We then disconnected from Maintenance and connected the call to the Chief Pilot; Name. The captain then asked Name if they could make an overweight landing; in which Name informed them they could. I then asked them if there was anything else I could do for them and the crew stated 'no.' We then disconnected the call. The aircraft held for ten more minutes; then landed in ZZZ with no further incident.
Human Factors,During pushback; we lost comm with the push crew. We came to a stop; but did not set brakes because we had no communication from ground personnel. We tried to signal the person with the wands; but they did not understand what we were trying to say. We noticed the airplane moving back at the same time the tug driver ran into view and gave us a crossed arms signal. We applied the brakes and the aircraft stopped. When the tug driver reestablished communication; she said a new person accidentally disconnected the airplane too early. She said nothing was contacted and there was no damage. It was just a normal disconnect.
Human Factors,Pushback from gate; after start checklist complete; cleared to taxi; lights on; area cleared; starting turnout to right; baggage driver approached at high speed and not stopping. I attempted to stop quickly; stop was more abrupt than anticipated. Baggage cart sped by unabated. Relief Pilot briefed passengers and checked in with Flight Attendant's. Copilot and I communicated with Ramp to report Baggage Cart Driver. Flight Attendant replied to Relief Pilot that they are okay to continue. Another couple inquiries before takeoff; same response. During flight; Flight Attendants were able to continue performing duties. Post landing debrief; 4 of 5 experienced some level of pain/discomfort.
Human Factors,Received information 10 minutes after push back that HAZMAT was not secured. HAZMAT not listed since it was less than 2.5lbs of dry ice.Flight came back to the gate.
Human Factors,Hazmat for later mainline trip was loaded on express trip.
Human Factors,737-700 pushed back from gate to spot Bravo. Employee followed procedures to remove bypass pin when brakes were set per policy and procedure. Employee put the pin in left gloved hand then proceeded to disconnect the wireless connector that allows communications to the cockpit and the push back driver. Employee put this device in left gloved hand as well. Employee then walked from right side of nose to left side of nose and headed back to gate.Once back at gate was putting equipment back into the lead box and realized that something was missing. Employee retraced steps and saw the bypass pin on the tarmac to just about 3 ft. from the left of the nose gear. The aircraft had already powered engines and was in the process of turning to the right because there was an Airbus directly in front of him.  Immediately notified the lead to get hold of supervisor or control center to have the aircraft stop or return to gate or something so that the bypass pin could be safely retrieved and removed from being a hazard on the tarmac/taxi area.The Captain/Crew did not get notified to stop and as the plane continued around the Airbus the bypass pin was ingested into the #1 engine. Employee and other members of the ground crew saw the bypass pin get lifted from the ground and into the engine and the noise that ensued. The flight had taxied away and when finally returned to gate; Maintenance met the aircraft.
Aircraft,"I was Captain on Date 3. On day 3; Date 4; we were assigned to fly Aircraft X; an Airbus 319; from ZZZ to ZZZ1. When we arrived at the aircraft; the Line Mechanic was going through the logbook and made a comment; paraphrasing; You might want to take a good look at the logbook."" So that is what we did.Date; Logbook Deferral Sheet (List) XXXXXXXX. Eng 2 FADEC A Fault; FADEC B Fault. Action taken: Replaced #2; something I can't read; engine run.

Refusing aircraft due to multiple write-ups for the same items - ELAC; stab trim. Should have included as Electronic Engine Control well.So YES; I declined the aircraft due to airworthy issues. I included the thoughts and views from the First Officer; Name; as well as the Line Mechanic. Soon thereafter I received a phone call from the Chief Pilot on duty. He asked what was going on and I informed him of my concerns and reiterated I was declining the aircraft. Not long after that I received a text from the Chief Pilot on duty which said the following: ""CA (Captain) - I looked at your logbook online and there has certainly been some recent work on [the] flight controls. The Maintenance Manager here would be glad to speak with you to help inform your decision. Please let me know if you need anything else."" I received another phone call offering to put the Maintenance Manager on the call; I declined that conversation as the FO (First Officer) and I were in complete concurrence. Comment: Just a bit of pilot pushing there I'd say.Eventually we got another aircraft and we left ZZZ for ZZZ1 about 4 ½ hours late. Being curious; I followed up on what happened with Aircraft X. The flight did depart with another crew to ZZZ2 on Date 4. The crew arrived in ZZZ at XA:46; the scheduled departure to ZZZ2 was XB:14; [and] they blocked OUT at XC:08. Still being curious; I looked in [the] electronic records and guess what I saw.Logbook Deferral Sheet (List) GGGGGGG. F/CTL ELAC 2 Pitch Fault. Aircraft X noted Out of Service.Suggestion - completing a flight check."""
Aircraft,Smelled musty fume smell on APU start then it dissipated with engines running. Smelled again randomly at cruise; then again more strongly during descent. We turned off each pack separately to try to isolate; it seemed to be worse with pack one on. Flight attendants also smelled throughout the cabin. We landed with pack one off and that seemed to somewhat limit the smell.Airplanes continue to have fume events. These fumes are dangerous; and this problem needs to be addressed by the entire industry.Find the cause; and fix.
Aircraft,"After Captain and I received an Over Temperature"" indication on Engine 1. We established he was the Pilot Flying and continued our takeoff as normal. After we completed the takeoff phase and entered the climb phase we identified the problem. The aircraft provided an ECAM message indicating us to shut down our engine in flight. However all of our engine indications were back in the green and functioning normally. We did have a tick mark saying we over temped but it did not say how much or how long.We elected to not follow the ECAM as we felt the engine was now functioning properly. Captain gave the aircraft to me and finished the rest of the checklist that was not required by the ECAM. He then attempted to contact company to inquiry whether it was appropriate to shut down the engine; return back; or keep going. At this point the ECAM was no longer telling us to shut down the engine but still had the tick where the engine over temped. We decided to turn around have the engine looked at. This required an overweight landing which triggered [requesting priority handling]. We [requested priority handling]; followed our checklist; chose the longest runway; and landed without further incident. It being a red eye flight was a factor. I felt the situation was handled very well. If I could do it again I would have turned back sooner but I also had no issue with burning some fuel for our overweight landing."""
Aircraft,Climbing out of ZZZ we got a #2 'Engine Oil Filter Bypass' light on engine display. QRC/QRH procedures were followed which led to shutting down the number 2 engine down. We requested priority handling and completed the remaining checklist items. We asked for and received vectors and returned back to ZZZ airport and landed on Runway XX. We cleared the Runway and were cleared into Gate X. We parked at Gate X without further incident.
Procedure,While supervising the unload in ZZZ a piece of hazmat that was not seen during the loading process in ZZZ1 was discovered. The hazmat was a class 2 non-flammable gas which should initially have been reported on the pilot notification form.While supervising the unload in ZZZ the hazmat was noticed for the first time. I believe this package went unnoticed while checking the information on a separate box of hazmat.The nature of the hazmat was noted and I called Safety to verify it was hazmat that should have been reported and find out how to proceed. I think this hazmat slipped past me on the belt loader while I was looking at a separate piece of hazmat to add to the pilot notification form. Next time the best idea may be to momentarily pause the loading process when looking at hazmat so nothing goes undetected.
Aircraft,During cruise cabin door light started to come on and off. At one point it stayed on for a few minutes. Determine when light start to blink to land at ZZZ1. Notice the light started to blink upon entering choppy air. After landing at ZZZ1 door was secure. Upon opening; a box was a laying against door. Moved box and secure door. Made the call to Chief Pilot and Maintenance Control. Door light was deferred. Departed ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 with no light or issue.
Aircraft,ADC 2 failed during the cruise on Airway ZZZ between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1 at FL360. Airspeed and Altitude indications became unstable; and autopilot had been disengaged since autopilot was coupled to ADC 2.
Aircraft,During boarding; our inflight notified me that they smelled a strong unpleasant odor of burning metal or burning plastic in the aft galley. When I walked back there; I could smell the same thing. I immediately turned off the APU bleed and we notified ZZZZ Maintenance. While entering the issue in the logbook; I could smell a faint odor similar to acetone or other chemical in the flight deck. The FO (First Officer) described the odor as a crayon smell. These descriptions are characteristic of fumes events as a result of oil burning in the ECS. Two inflight crew members experienced mild nausea and I experienced a mild headache which resolved about 30 minutes later.The first Mechanic to arrive told us that the plane would be taken out of service for several hours and that we could expect a tail swap. We communicated with operations to deplane all customers and did so.The next Mechanic to show appeared to be in a managerial or supervisory role and was dressed differently than the others. He very sternly questioned me as to how I knew it to be a fume event if all packs were off. I explained that I turned them off to stop the fume event from occurring. He then told me that he didn't smell anything and that it could not be a real fume event because the inbound crew had no problems last night. I explained that 5 crew members confirmed the odor along with 2 customers who complained about the odor. He then explained that he would run both packs once fully deplaned and that he would simply sign it off and return it to service if he doesn't smell anything. I professionally advised against it; and recommended that he appropriately follow the guidance in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual and Information Notice. I filled out the Maintenance Odor Form and handed it over to him.Shortly thereafter; we were given a different aircraft and flew uneventfully to ZZZ. Upon arriving in ZZZ; multiple customers thanked us for changing aircraft because the first aircraft; 'was very smelly' (their words). An elderly woman and her caretaker said the smell was awful in the last row.
Aircraft,I was first made aware of a dirty sock odor after the arrival of Aircraft X; ZZZ to ZZZZ.Upon landing and learning that we had to wait for a gate; we set up for a single engine taxi and shut down the number 2 engine. When we opened the flight deck door; the Flight Attendant 1 informed me that the Flight Attendant 3 smelled the odor on descent about 10 minutes out from landing. The cabin crew reported that the smell was still there at gate arrival but had dissipated a bit after engine 2 shutdown.I made a pass through the cabin and definitely smelled the odor lightly by mid cabin and more heavy in the rear of the aircraft. Since I didn't have advance notice of the odor; I didn't initiate any procedures. The odor spread throughout the aircraft as we sought to isolate the source with the mechanics.I called Dispatch via SATCOM and was patched through to maintenance who in turn had the local technicians attempt to isolate the smell. Following an engine run at the gate; it became apparent that pack 2 was the origination of the odor. Pack 2 was put on MEL and we operated the flight back to ZZZ on Pack 1 alone.The smell in the cabin was better on the return flight but the smell lingered thoughout the cabin and the flight deck all the way back to ZZZ where a Technician notified us of an odor history and took the aircraft out of service.The Flight Attendant 3 reported a burning sensation in his eyes on descent into ZZZZ associated with the odor. The cabin crew double masked once the smell was noticed but reported headaches with the smell. In helping the local mechanics analyze the problem; I too felt stomach pains and an associated headache due to the odor. None of the crew ever reported feeling sick enough to be ambulatory.
Aircraft,During vectors for our approach into ZZZ; we noticed a 'dirty sock' smell in the Cockpit. The packs were on the engine bleeds and the APU was off. We isolated each pack; but the result was the same. We started the APU and used the APU bleed for the packs; but we did not notice a change. Our landing was uneventful. We later learned the 'dirty sock' smell was encountered throughout the cabin. I entered this maintence discrepancy into the logbook and completed the odor/smoke form.
Human Factors,[The incident] occurred during [a] regular overnight maintenance shift. Action was the replacement of a left angle of attack sensor. During replacement of a panel associated with this sensor in the pressurized part of the aircraft; improper fasteners with an excessive grip length were used by someone under my supervision; which I failed to notice due to performing other maintenance tasks in the hangar. The excessive grip length caused the screws to bottom out against their nut plates and record sufficient torque for installation before the panel was completely in place. My post-installation inspection of the work did not catch the improper installation; which was not visible once the panel was installed and sealed. This problem was discovered when mechanics pressurized the aircraft for other maintenance and felt a leak from the AOA panel as they passed by. They installed a new AOA sensor and noticed that the screws had an incorrect grip length; so they replaced the attaching hardware to correct the problem.The causes of the event include: a lack of knowledge about fasteners by an employee with about 7 months of experience; my failure to train this employee on types of fasteners; lack of good standard procedures for verifying the correct fastener.This incident will result in everyone with limited experience getting a lecture and demonstration of different fasteners used on our aircraft. Also; procedures will be updated to require everyone to compare old fasteners with new ones for each installation. In the event of any doubt about whether the correct fasteners are available; technicians are to consult a Crew Lead.
Aircraft,"Air turn back due to maintenance. Following an uneventful taxi-out; takeoff and climb through FL217; a moderately loud bang was heard with simultaneous right roll and yaw. Engine parameters were immediately checked and found to be normal. A moderately loud rumbling was noted and seemed to be emanating from the nose area. The aircraft remained on autopilot during the event.Climb was continued to FL320 but the Pilot Flying noted that only a slow rate of 750 FPM - 1200 FPM was obtainable. Following some troubleshooting including slowing to 190 kts. and cycling the gear; the crew noted that the right engine Oil Pressure"" was no longer being sensed (amber dashed lines) and that the oil temperature in the right engine was indicating substantially lower than the left engine. ZZZ Maintenance Control and Dispatch were contacted and the decision made to return.Following the turn back; further discussion between the crew led to the decision to perform a precautionary shutdown of the right engine as per the Emergency/Abnormal Procedures checklist. As a further precautionary measure; priority handling was requested with ATC. ATC provided normal vectors to a visual approach. At no time during this event did any system fail nor were any CAS messages present. Following an uneventful approach and landing the aircraft was taxied to the parking ramp where it was found that the right engine cowling had partially detached from its mounting attachments."""
Aircraft,While configuring on left downwind for a visual to XXR; we selected Flaps-1. After several seconds; the LE FLAPS ASYMMETRY light stayed on. We referenced the overhead panel; and noticed one of the LE device lights was not green. The Captain requested priority handling; coordinated for vectors around the pattern; and ran the LE Flap Asymmetry checklist while I flew the plane. After the checklist was complete; we landed uneventfully and taxied to the gate. The situation was terminated and we discussed the specific flap issue face-to-face with Maintenance.
Aircraft,Enroute ZZZ-ZZZ1; FL390. Cabin Host (CH) alerted crew to smoke in galley. I went to galley and there was mod to heavy smoke coming out of closet forward of galley. Appeared to be coming from behind panels. I could not identify source. I turned off AC & DC power to cabin / galley. I [requested priority] handling and ATC gave options to divert to ZZZ2 or ZZZ3. ZZZ3 was closer and weather was good. We initiated a descent and proceeded to ZZZ3. CH kept me informed on the smoke. Was isolated to the galley area and was not entering the cabin. I elected not to drop the O2 masks. I had the CH take a seat in the cabin. I elected to land 1000 lbs over weight. We landed Runway XX; exited to the right on Taxiway 1 and shut plane down and had everyone vacate plane. By that point the smoke had dissipated but was still very strong odor of burned electrical. With all power off plane and batteries disconnected no evidence of continuing smoke or issues. After about 30 minutes; FBO towed the plane to the FBO. Was determined to be failed Data Concentrator Unit (DCU) and DCU Fan. Equipment failure. Nothing would prevent from happening again that I'm aware of.
Aircraft,We were climbing out of 35;000 ft. when we received a number of faults all at the same time. It included; R FADEC fault 2; L FADEC fault 2; anti-skid fault; rudder limit fault; DCU2 INOP; [and] DCU2 aural INOP. Then; 5 minutes later; we received an elevator split caution message. [The] aircraft had just come out of the in-seat power installment and this was the first flight on the line.  As we tried to figure out exactly what was going on; we also heard the shrill beeping sound that the aircraft makes when it is initially powered up after turning the master switch on. It was clear to us that we needed to turn around. We were not sure if it was electrical faults or a possible fire that was shorting out or kicking off our systems - nor did we know if we were going to be experiencing some kind of flight control issues due to these faults.  The FO (First Officer) was flying while I ran the QRH; [requesting priority handling] on the radio to ATC and sent ACARS to the Company. The split elevator caution was intermittent. We descended to an altitude that we could comply with the QRH 200-kt. limitation. I elected to do the landing due to the fact that it was an overweight landing. Our landing weight was 74;231 lb. We executed a flaps 20 landing as per the QRH for [the] split elevator procedure. After we deplaned; I was on the phone with Maintenance for a lengthy amount of time figuring how to do the write-up.  By this time; there was no way that we would have been able to fly to ZZZ1 - ZZZ2 and back within our duty time period. This fact did not stop Crew Tracking from trying to misrepresent the scheduled turn time and flight times to get it to artificially fit it within our duty day. They somehow reduced our ZZZ1 - ZZZ2 flight time from 2 hours and 1 minute to 1 hour and fifty-three minutes. They reduced our turn time by one minute. These were completely unrealistic and desperately hopeful numbers to begin with and put us within 9 minutes of timing out if we blocked out exactly at XA:30. At XB:16; I called Crew Tracking to inform them that the crew was still on Aircraft X and the replacement aircraft still was not boarded. We were told that we were still legal to fly the flight when clearly; we were timed out at XA:39. This molestation of scheduled flight time is a common and overused tactic by Company Crew Tracking. This tactic is unsafe and should not be tolerated by crews nor the FAA. If [the] Company is at all concerned with [the] safety of its passengers and crews; then it should be a policy [that] after a [priority handling] landing; the crew is placed on rest; like so many other airlines have. Crew Tracking shouldn't be able to pressure crews with more legs because they can artificially fit them within the duty day.  The second issue with Crew Tracking is the pressure to call in fatigued. We were being pressured to depart on a trip that realistically could not fit within our duty period; we were going to be too tired to fly after the [priority handling] event; and the supervisor was leaving us no option but to call fatigued even though we were already unable to complete the turn without extending. I will be writing a separate safety report on this subject matter. But I will say that I did feel the pressure to continue flying even though we were already timed out and had to argue with them to drop the trip from both the FO and I.In the end we got the plane on the ground as quickly as possible; got everyone to the airport safely; and did so by assuming the worst and taking the most conservative action. Huge thanks to my FO who performed perfectly and our FAs (Flight Attendant) for keeping our cabin calm and comfortable. The call with Crew Tracking was on Date at XB:16.If [the] Company is at all concerned with [the] safety of its passengers and crews; then it should be a policy after an immediate landing; the crew is placed on rest; like so many other airlines have. Crew Tracking shouldn't be able to pressure crewswith more legs because they can artificially fit them within the duty day especially after an inflight [event]. [The] Company Crew Tracking should not be adjusting scheduled flight times to artificially fit a flight within a crew's duty day. More maintenance checks need to be made before placing an aircraft back into service after major electrical / mechanical modifications.
Aircraft,Upon arrival in ZZZ on our second leg of duty period one; we were rescheduled to fly ZZZ-ZZZ2 instead of our published schedule of ZZZ-ZZZ1. FO (First Officer)  and I proceeded to the ZZZ2 flight and when I arrived I was told by the Gate Agent that all passengers were either onboard or in the jet way waiting to board. As I made my way down to the aircraft I found approximately 15 passengers were still on the jet way and that the flight attendants had stopped the boarding process due to the ground power tripping off line and the aircraft being dark. The aircraft was also very warm and there was a musty smell in the cabin. Since the ground air conditioning had never been hooked up and the APU was not started; I assumed that this odor was a result of the aircraft sitting for a period of time in rainy and very humid conditions with no air circulation. I immediately started the APU and applied bleed air to the packs and the boarding process was completed. FO and I completed out pre-flight preparations and we pushed of the gate and taxied to Runway XXC and departed uneventfully. Passing 8;000 ft. on our climb out; we received a call from a flight attendant stating that a passenger was complaining of an irritating odor and a burning sensation in her eyes. I asked the FA (Flight Attendant) if they were experiencing the same thing and was told that they could still smell the musty; sweaty socks odor but no eye irritation. At that point I suggested that we wait a few minutes to see if the odor dissipates thinking that it may just be some moisture in the AC system that would burn off. After about five minutes I called all flight attendant stations for an update and I asked for a consensus on whether the odor was getting better or worse or staying the same. All the FA's agreed that the odor seemed to be subsiding and they were OK with proceeding to ZZZ1. It was then when FO stated that he could still smell the odor and that he was developing a headache. At that point I decided that we needed to return to ZZZ. After [advising ATC] we were cleared direct to ZZZ and we started our descent; notified Dispatch and ZZZ operation; completed all applicable check lists; QRH procedures and the over weight landing assessment. We touched down on Runway XXC in ZZZ at a weight of 188;800 lbs at 155 IAS and taxied to the gate uneventfully. At the gate all passengers were deplaned and I made the appropriate logbook entries in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook. The flight attendants were met by someone who I believed to be an in flight Supervisor and were escorted off the jet way by them. FO and myself were the last two off the aircraft and when we reached the gate area; the flight attendants and the in flight Supervisor were nowhere to be seen.
Human Factors,Last evening; my Second in Command (SIC) reported to my Supervisor at FBO that we took off over the MTOW. Dispatcher X is new to the company and is unfamiliar with The software we use to file flight plans and compute weight and balance. His assumptions are based on numbers that are difficult to determine. And his familiarity with the peculiarities of the fuel tanks is limited.Baggage weight is a guess. Passenger weights are rarely accurate as reported; and are also a guess. None of these items are routinely weighed for accuracy. The fuel gauges are not reliable and never reflect the actual tank capacities stated in the AFM. Variations occur due to the temperature-related; specific fuel density as well; and are not compensated for as they are with the large fuel quantities in heavy aircraft.Even if the caps are removed; it's impossible to determine if the tanks are full or not due to their construction. If the aircraft is not sitting on a perfectly level ramp; the indicated fuel quantities can vary by several hundred pounds. Furthermore; due to lack of biologic (Fuel Additives) treatment on a regular basis; fuel gauges can vary by several hundred pounds due to contamination.The BOW (Basic Operating Weight) is a default number inserted in the FMS. It can be changed by anyone. There is no current 337 in the weight and balance section of the AFM. One must assume that number is recorded elsewhere. And the accuracy of that number is questionable; absent any current 337. Hence; Dispatcher X's computations are guesses. He has no certifiably accurate means of determining the Take-Off Weight at the time of departure.Based on my 2;000 hours of experience in the aircraft; the numbers appeared to be within the nominal limits as best as anyone can determine. While it is entirely possible that several weight and balance limitations have been exceeded during various phases of multiple flights; they are not apparent and not easily determined hard numbers given the vagaries of the measurements involved. At no time have I knowingly or intentionally operated the aircraft outside of published AFM limitations. Any indications to the contrary are well within the margins of error illustrated above. As a further note; FBO aircraft are routinely operated at weights at or near the MTOW of 16;300 pounds. The aircraft performed like it always has with no notable differences in feel or performance.It should be noted that Dispatcher X has failed to meet the performance standards expected of [the] FBO Captain after several months on the job as an SIC.
Aircraft,Foul odor upon entering aircraft but dissipated during passenger boarding. On takeoff; the odor became very strong and passenger complaints were received of burning eyes; nose; and throat. Pilots reported light headedness to the flight attendants. Flight attendants reported the same to Flight Deck. Diverted back to ZZZ. No emergency evacuation. White smoke like cloud observed in the cavity between paneling above windows and corner of ceiling where passenger controls and air vents located. I do not have enough knowledge of what caused the issue or what could be done to prevent it.
Human Factors,The only hole in a large line of weather was forcing most all aircraft through my sectors. I was asked to work 'one more' MCO lander and if they could resume departures. I agreed with 20 MIT because I knew I would not have to climb head on with arrivals. Unfortunately; I did not know I was about to be handed multiple southbound deviating slow GA aircraft. I had them at 17000; 16000; 14000 ft.; and all needing deviations. I forced my MCO lander down early to get under the props. In the meantime I took handoff on Aircraft Y; an MCO turboprop departure at 12;000. The complexity kept building; and then F11 said I had to spin Aircraft X; the departure who was currently at 12;000 ft. When the aircraft turned; they became in conflict with Aircraft Y; and I did not recognize it. Just prior to conflict alert; my tracker noticed and in a panic; I descended Aircraft X into DAB airspace at 11;000 ft. without a pointout. The aircraft were probably 1 minute from hitting and it was simply my first reaction.I should have been more diligent in my duty to protect the integrity of my sector. I was being asked to do too much and pressured to do more and I caved. We did wind up spinning several aircraft; but I should have taken more proactive actions earlier. I'd recommend systemic changes to help protect sectors impacted by severe weather; but I figure at this point why bother? Pull the tape and look for yourselves. Pull the tape from last Saturday; last Thursday; or any other day when there weren't 100% ideal weather conditions at ZJX. No matter what; the pressure to 'keep them moving' takes precedence over doing the right thing. Controllers are being forced to recognize on position in the heat of the moment that things are going from bad to worse and then dump the burden of no notice holding on their co-workers because nobody with a higher level view is capable or willing to see what's happening in a timely manner. I; for one have learned my lesson and vow to never again allow a sector I'm responsible for to get that way ever again.
Aircraft,Aircraft X scheduled to operate ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. Push; engine start; taxi; and takeoff were uneventful. On climb out; aircraft entered IMC and icing conditions; and Captain turned on engine anti-ice. At approximately 16;000 ft. MSL; Crew observed 'IAS DISAGREE' and 'ALT DISAGREE' on the Primary Flight Displays; followed very shortly by Master Caution; ENG caution indicator; and both EEC 'ALTN' lights illuminated. Crew noted the Captain's airspeed to be significantly lower than the First Officer's and standby airspeed; so Captain transferred aircraft control to First Officer.Crew completed the Airspeed Unreliable memory items; and then coordinated with ATC to level at FL190 and maintain current heading to continue troubleshooting. After leveling off; Captain's airspeed showed approximately 100 knots below First Officer's and standby airspeed. Captain's altimeter showed approximately 300 ft. higher than First Officer's and standby altimeter. Crew ran the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist from the Quick Reference Checklist and Quick Reference Handbook; up to deferred items; and requested priority handling with ATC. Crew determined the First Officer's airspeed and altitude were reliable; so in accordance with the Quick Reference Handbook; the First Officer re-engaged Flight Director and autopilot.After determining ZZZ3 as a suitable divert field; Crew informed ATC and Dispatch of intention to divert; and then informed Flight Attendants and Passengers of the situation. Crew then ran the EEC Alternate Mode Checklist from the Quick Reference Handbook; placing both engines in hard alternate mode. Crew also completed the diversion checklist and the deferred items from the Airspeed Unreliable Checklist. On arrival; below approximately 10;000 ft. and in VMC; Crew observed Captain's airspeed and altitude to be indicating correctly. First Officer flew an uneventful visual approach to Runway XXL and overweight landing at ZZZ3 (LGW 131;000 pounds). Taxi in to Gate X and shutdown were uneventful.
Aircraft,I was the relief pilot for this flight. The Captain was the Flying Pilot. When he returned from the second break it; was noted that the left engine oil quantity had been dropping. The left engine oil quantity had dropped from 7 to 3 in the matter of about 30 minutes. The oil pressure and temperature was remaining consistent at 196 psi and 110 degrees. Since there is not a procedure for low quantity; the Captain contacted Dispatch and Maintenance to advise of the situation. See if they could see and monitor engine parameters and to discuss then next step if the quantity did in fact reach zero. He advised to monitor. The Crew discussed possible diversion airports and weather. The FM and QRH were referenced for the appropriate checklist and procedures if the engine oil parameters deteriorated. The left engine oil quantity did in fact reach zero and I began keeping track of the engine parameters for trends. The engine went to zero quantity at XA:27. The engine oil pressure and temperature remained consistent for 25 minutes. At this point we had left the tracks; in radar contact with ZZZZ and been given clearance for ZZZZZ direct ZZZ. Once the oil pressure began to drop and it became apparent it was not a quantity sensor issue the Flight Attendant was called to provide a restroom break; be given a heads up briefing and asked to wake the Pilot Monitoring First Officer.While waiting for the third Pilot to return to the flight deck; Dispatch and Maintenance were consulted. During this communication; the engine oil pressure light began to flicker. Within minutes; the oil pressure was boxed and red on the engine indicators. Knowing that the QRH for L Eng oil pressure led to an inflight shutdown; the Captain discussed diversion with Dispatch. The third Pilot returned to the flight deck. He began the QRH procedures. I advised the lead Flight Attendant of the situation and provided the briefing items. I then made an announcement to the people. Once we were vectored to ZZZZ1 I provided the Flight Attendants and the passengers and updated time of landing. Also advised passengers why the lights went out momentarily during the transfer of power to the app. The QRH and landing distance computations were completed. A flaps 20 ILS was planned for ZZZZ1. Emergency equipment were in place and standing by. The weather was VFR clouds and visibility. Winds favored the runway but were gusty. Approximately 260 at 24 gusting 35. Appropriate adjustments were made to VREF.Landing was in the touchdown zone. Rollout and stop were as expected with the single thrust reverser and wind gust. The aircraft completed a 180 at the end of the runway and exited at taxiway Alpha. Emergency equipment followed and inspected the aircraft. Once entering the temp area the left truck break temperature had risen. The aircraft was stopped. The Fire Chief advised they saw fire. They sprayed and extinguished the fire. The Brake Temperature Monitoring System (BTMS) Checklist was completed and 1 hour was needed before moving aircraft again. I advised the Flight Attendant and passengers. The Flight Attendants decided to use that hour to serve the passengers breakfast. I communicated with Operations on plan for the passengers and aircraft.Once time was complete. The Aircraft was towed to the gate and met by Mechanics and Ground Security Coordinator.
Aircraft,During taxi there was a brake check and [we then] departed and flew to ZZZ1. After touchdown [we] discovered there was no left brake after flaps [came] up and under 40 kts indicated. At that point the right brake grabbed and pulled to the right; pulling aircraft off runway. After getting stopped I talked it over with my crew and felt it was safe trying to taxi back to runway and called Tower for the request and [he] asked me if I needed [assistance]. At that time I just stayed in communication with Tower; then once cleared from the runway I contacted Ground and talked with them. Airport authority came to where I shut down the PC-12 and made sure things were safe with us and airport operations. [In the future I will] verify that I have brake pressure on final with brake system.
Human Factors,While landing Runway XX passing through 2000 ft. the FO (pilot flying) called for the gear. The gear would not come down. We executed a non eventful discontinued approach. We climbed to 3000ft runway heading. Tower switched us to approach. They gave us an extended box pattern for runway 36C. We tried to contact company (unsuccessfully) and set up for 36C ILS and program the FMC. We transferred controls and ran the QRH (quick reference handbook) for manually extended the gear. We ran our checklist (all the while trying to reach company). While we running the checklist we switched to final approach control (this will be discussed below). We turned final and landed and rolled out to the end of 36c uneventfully. We shut down and waited for a tug back to company property. The Tower and first approach controller were extremely helpful and professional. The final approach controller I have some issues with.As we were heading east back towards the arrival pattern; we were 3000 ft and she called traffic; a 76 southbound at 4000 ft. We acknowledged the contact; she then told us; a priority aircraft to maintain visible separation. The workload was rather high at this point and adding 'maintain visible separation' seemed a bit unnecessary. When we turned final and called the field; she cleared us for the visual. Then she came back and told us to maintain 170 kts to a 5 mile final. I took the radio call and explained we're a priority aircraft and we're unable; she then demanded to know what speed we were going to fly. As a priority aircraft; running checklist; multiple radios; and flying; it seemed like the final controller did not give us the proper priority. Captain's Reaction to the event: Landing gear malfunction: Improper handling of a priority aircraft by final approach control.
Aircraft,Enroute about 1.5 hours into the flight we received a level 2 fuel qty/used check alert. After running the QRH procedure we determined that their was no abnormal leak from tanks 1;2 or 3. We then isolated the aux tank and when the x-feed manifold was pressurized we determined that there was an excessive fuel loss (eg. normal fuel burn would be about 350 lb/min. We were showing a loss of about 1;100 lb/min.). We contacted Operations and Maintenance; and elected to return to ZZZ. On the return we dumped approximately 60;000 lbs of fuel to get below our max landing weight between 200 and 100 miles west of ZZZ at FL270. We requested priority handling and had CFR inspect the airplane after landing to look for possible leak. None was noted so we continued to taxi to the Gate.
Aircraft,Approaching top of climb while in route from ZZZ to ZZZ1; we received multiple gear disagree messages associated with the nose wheel indicating unlocked. We transferred flight controls and proceeded with the QRH. We made the decision to return to ZZZ based on suitable Runway length and support for passengers and maintenance. We requested priority handling and returned to ZZZ. ATC gave us vectors to fly on a downwind for the ZZZ Tower inspect the landing gear. Landing was successful.
Human Factors,On a night FMS bridge visual to Runway 28R to SFO; we got significantly low on the glide path and had a glide-slope warning. I was the Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the FO was the Pilot Flying (PF). I thought we were in LNAV VNAV; on the approach profile with the ILS frequency also plugged in. I'm thinking we maybe we were in level change based on how low we got. The PF did not disengage the autopilot until we realized we were significantly low. How low I'm not sure; but the PAPI/VASI was showing 4 red when I snapped my attention to the situation. The VSD also showed us significantly low. As soon as I looked out front; I said to the PF to 'get two white lights on the PAPI'. He leveled off and added power. I thought of taking the aircraft but he was making excellent corrections. A go-around could have been warranted but we elected to land as we intercepted the glide path. I'm glad I had the VSD up; but I did not use it early enough as the PM to avoid this situation.Causal factors: Fatigue; we were rested but it had been a long 5 hours since [departure]. Complacency; it was perfect weather and both thought LNAV VNAV was a great plan to have some guidance; then followed the flight director too low in altitude. Experience; the PF was highly experienced in the Aircraft X and I was somewhat inattentive or complacent as the PM. I assumed all was good. Distraction; I did not have my head fully in the cockpit prior to our first indication of an issue. This was 100% human factors. I don't think we got ourselves close to an incident but getting low is a never good on an approach. Ultimately; I failed to monitor the flight path and we ended up in an undesirable aircraft state.
Human Factors,I was the PF and we were getting vectored; was then cleared to waypoint UN540 and cleared for approach. I honestly didn't remember if it was clear for the Visual or for ILSDME 4 12R. I mistook UN540 which has a crossing altitude of 2000 feet for the next point; the FAF of UN545 which has a crossing altitude of 1300 feet. I verbalized setting 1300 feet but I must have not said it loud enough as I did not get a confirmation of the altitude from the Captain. As I was approaching UN540 I realized I was at 1300 ft. and was approaching the wrong fix then I initially suspected. I was 700 ft. lower then I was supposed to be. The Captain noticed it at the same time; we were in visual conditions so decided to continue the approach and intercept the GS at the correct spot of UN545. We went on to land without any incident. One cause I believe is I didn't double check the waypoint or I did it to quickly and just saw UN and proceeded to set the wrong altitude. In the future I will double check crossing restrictions more thoroughly and speak louder and make sure I get a response when setting an altitude to allow my coworker to catch a mistake if one made. This was also my first flight back from 3 weeks vacation with an early show. Believe a little fatigue and rust from not being in the plane played a role in my mistake.
Procedure,On approach to Seattle; was radar vectored to join the localizer [for Runway] 16R from the west; and given a mandatory descent to 3000 ft. This put us underneath preceding traffic 5 miles ahead; an A-321 which joined the glide slope [Runway] 16R straight in from 4000 ft. With light to non-existent winds in the lower atmosphere; the result was predictable; moderate wake turbulence consisting of several rhythmic jolts followed by several rolls of 20-30 deg bank before I was able to safely maneuver out of the wake. Positioned aircraft about a quarter mile west of localizer and climbed to approximately 3200 ft. to get out of the wake; then had to fly one dot above glide slope to stay out of the Airbus' wake as they were a bit high on their approach. Remainder of approach and landing was normal and uneventful. Submitting this report in case there are any passenger concerns or inquiries. After a smooth flight up the coast from ZZZ; I am sure a few nerves in the back were rattled.  I am not sure why ATC needed us to join the localizer at 3000 ft. If given 4000 ft; our ability to avoid the Airbus' wake would have been much improved. Alternatively; the curved path of the RNAV approach to [Runway] 16R would have mitigated our exposure time to wake turbulence. We elected to stay on the instrument approach this flight to mitigate the effects of our fatiguing schedule. In the future will give more consideration to the visual approach; even when fatigued; as a wake turbulence mitigation strategy.
Human Factors,We were cleared to land on Runway XXC by Tower on frequency XXX.XX at ZZZ. While outside a 5 mile final; I heard Tower issuing hold short instructions to another aircraft; Aircraft Y. That aircraft was issued instructions to hold short of Runway XXC at Taxiway X; so we could land. I overheard some confusion with that aircraft by the pilots with that clearance to hold short. As we were approaching 500 ft. above the ground; I remembered hearing the confusion that the Aircraft Y had with the hold short instruction; so I looked towards Taxiway X to make sure that the aircraft was actually holding short of our landing runway. The sun was starting to go down at this time; so it was very difficult to see the Aircraft Y and its position relative to the hold short line at that taxiway (from the altitude we were at). It did appear however that the aircraft was behind the hold short line and was indeed holding short of our landing runway. As a result; we elected to continue the approach and land. During the landing roll out on XXC rolling past Taxiway X; it was clearly evident that the Aircraft Y was 1/3 across the hold short line and was technically in a runway incursion status while we landed the aircraft. On the landing rollout; I queried Tower; my exact words; 'Tower Aircraft X; on the landing rollout; it would have been nice to know that Aircraft Y was across the hold short line at X.' I was Pilot not Flying (PNF) and then at 60 kts.; I took the flight controls and cleared the runway. While taxiing in; the Tower Controller queried the Aircraft Y if he was actually holding short and the Aircraft Y pilot actually admitted over frequency that he was across the hold short line by 3-5 ft. (it was clearly more than that however; it was the first 1/3 of their aircraft). Upon taxi in; we were given a phone number to call and I discussed the situation with a ZZZ Tower Manager. He agreed that ASRS reports should be filed. Captain's Analysis:We should have initiated a go-around if any doubt at all existed that the aircraft was not holding short of our landing runway. I should have queried ATC before landing to ensure if the aircraft was holding short (after hearing the previous confusion with the Aircraft Y crew on the hold short instructions on frequency while we were outside a 5 mile final). Aircraft Y should have informed the Tower that they had accidentally crossed the hold short line and Tower could have then issued us a go-around clearance. ATC could have double checked to ensure Aircraft Y was holding short after the previous confusion existed.
Aircraft,We were performing a passenger flight from ZZZ-ZZZ1. Upon takeoff and early climb; the aircraft pressurization system was working normally. At approximately 11;000 ft. MSL; we received a 'press sys' cautionary light indicating the pressurization controller has malfunctioned. At roughly 12;000 ft. the system faulted and we completely lost pressurization indicated by the cabin climbing rapidly to our altitude and the emergency pressurization automatically turning on. We requested to descend to troubleshoot the problem and we were cleared to level off for about a minute.We were then cleared to descend to 10;000 ft. and shortly followed by 9;000 ft. We had to descend quickly due to the emergency pressure being extremely hot and upsetting the passengers. The system was supposed to be able to reset/turn off at 9;500 ft. but it did not until roughly 3;000 ft. on short vectors for the ILS back into ZZZ airport. Descending through about 5;000 ft.; we began to smell something burning but figured it was from the emergency air as there was no visible smoke inside of the airplane.For this reason; we requested priority vectors to the airport but did not [request priority handling]. We did try to reset the system numerous times but the system had completely faulted out and required a reset of aircraft power. I cycled the bleed air off numerous times without success until 3;000 ft. as well as cabin air and cabin dump below 10;000 ft.; all to no avail. We were able to land without incident and after resetting the cabin power; the pressurization system seemed to work properly evidenced by the lack of the fault lights that were present on the flight.
Ambiguous,As we called for pushback it became apparent that Ground Control was acting as both Ground and Clearance Delivery on the Ground Control frequency. There were numerous aircraft requesting; pushback; clearance and taxi. We were stepped on multiple times calling for and receiving pushback clearance. We were left on Ground Control frequency for our taxi; including crossing Runway XX and XYL for taxi to Runway XX at D3 for takeoff. At approximately XX43Z; we were cleared to 'cross Runway XYL at J2 and taxi to Runway XX via F and D.' After read back of instructions; I then turned the strobe and wing lights on and upon hearing the Captain state; 'clear left'; I looked to my right; cleared the right side and stated 'clear right.' As we were about to cross the runway edge line (we had already crossed the hold short line); the Ground Controller stated '(Company) STOP' over Ground Control frequency.The Captain immediately slammed on the brakes bringing the aircraft to an abrupt stop. I immediately looked left to see a [single engine high wing aircraft] going around to avoid us. His altitude was less than 50 ft. as I saw him climbing out. Ground Control then stated 'oh good; they are going around to miss you.' Once it was apparent that we were not going to collide; Ground Control immediately re-cleared us to cross Runway XYL at J2 and taxi via F and D. I repeated the clearance and we proceeded to cross. About 10 seconds later; a different Ground Control voice told us to switch to Tower frequency. The Captain then called the FAs (flight attendant) to ensure no one was injured during the abrupt stop. One of our FAs was jostled into the bulkhead during the stop but no one was injured. We then proceeded to takeoff uneventfully. Air Traffic Controllers (including Ground Control) need to be handling one function at a time. While the regulations may allow for multiple frequency coverage and combining of functions (Ground and Clearance) it is apparent that they cannot do both well. Additionally; with a high volume of traffic at ZZZ; we should have been switched to Tower frequency for runway crossings to avoid a landing aircraft conflict with us taxiing.
Aircraft,During climbout at approximately FL240; the First Officer's windshield R1 suddenly cracked. It was determined to be the outer layer of the window. We immediately leveled off; and asked ATC for a return. We ran the appropriate Quick Reference Handbook Checklist and Diversion Checklist. Dispatch seemed to immediately know that something wasn't right and we responded to their message confirming an air return. We notified the Flight Attendants first; then the passengers telling them exactly what had happened and why we were returning to Denver.We did not request priority handling but ATC began to refer to us as a critical aircraft so we went with that assuming that they had declared priority handling for us. We made an uneventful smooth overweight landing. There were multiple emergency vehicles lined along the runway as we landed. Logbook entries were made for both the cracked windshield; and the overweight landing specifying the smooth landing and a brakes-on speed of 65 kts. Dispatch and Maintenance Control were called at the gate. Another aircraft had been designated for the continuation of the flight. The First Officer and I determined that we were okay to continue to operate the [next] flight.
Ambiguous,On visual approach backed by the ILS into ZZZ XXR; very gusty crosswinds on final. Final configuration checked and checklist complete; at slightly under 100 knots on short final near the overrun; a GPWS warning announced. After assessing glide path was normal; descent rate was normal; no terrain conflict was in sight and airspeed was fluctuating due to gusty crosswind at that moment we felt the we were still in a safe position to land in the touchdown zone and the decision to land was safer than going around with a wide body aircraft turning right over the departure end of the runway. PF (pilot flying) landed in the touchdown zone and brought the aircraft to taxi speed and exited the runway. During the debrief we believe the GPWS warning to be either erroneous or related to the very gusty erratic crosswinds.
Human Factors,We incurred an altitude deviation of about 500 ft. above our assigned altitude of 5;000 ft. The sequence of events are as follows:Visual approach to [Runway] 24R at LAX resulted in a go around at about 200 ft. due to wake turbulence from preceding aircraft. I was Pilot Monitoring. We climbed straight ahead to 2;000 ft. Followed MA procedures timely and accurately. We were then given direct SMO and climb to 5;000 ft. Reaching 5;000 ft. and established on direct course to SMO we were alerted to traffic at about 11 o'clock. As we made visual contact we received an RA to descend. The Captain followed to RA guidance to descend to about 4;000 ft. Once clear of conflict he began a climb back to 5;000 ft. I verified with SoCal that 5;000 ft. was the target altitude. Climbing through 4;500 ft. I called 500 ft. to go. The Captain acknowledged and was attempting to level off at 5;000 ft. We went through the altitude by 500 ft. and promptly returned to 5;000 ft. We then continued to set up for the next approach. During the recovery from the RA I was monitoring the outside traffic and the energy state of the aircraft. The initial recovery resulted in a high thrust setting and nose high pitch; too much for what was required for a 1;000 ft. climb. We both recognized this. Thus the Captain allowed the aircraft to climb through the altitude by 500 ft. rather than an abrupt level off that would have certainly been distressing to the crew and passengers. We returned immediately to 5;000 ft.; our assigned altitude. We were never behind the aircraft or missing anything procedurally. We were though very task saturated due to the rate at which these events did occur.During the climb back to 5;000 ft. the Captain engaged the autothrottle and the autopilot but due to the control forces on the yoke the autopilot never engaged. With time being critical this was enough to delay level off. I was monitoring many things but could have backed him up a bit better on energy management.
Aircraft,Upon arrival at the gate; Flight Attendant (FA) notified me they detected an odor in the area of the aft jumpseats/galley during descent. One FA reported a burning sensation in her throat. The other (both seated in the aft jumpseats) reported feeling light headed and having a headache. They described it like 'an aerosol or ozone that you would experience in a hair salon'
Ambiguous,I'll start by saying I believe there was a controller in training at the time of this occurrence. I say that because during our taxi in on the leg prior; we heard two different controllers on ground like when a supervisor overrides another controller on the same freq. This did not happen again that I recall; but thinking back; there could have been some distractions in the Tower when our takeoff clearance was given. Wind was out of the west around 10 knots. There were many smaller airplanes doing left traffic pattern work on Runway 31 during our takeoff. Around the time of our takeoff I heard the controller tell someone in the pattern to start a turn. The PF (pilot flying) performed a very nice static takeoff on Runway 23. After positive rate and gear retraction; we quickly were at 400' when the PF called for NAV mode on the flight guidance (Morristown 7 departure). I immediately noticed traffic off our right to be Aircraft Y in the left downwind for Runway 31; slightly above us. As we climbed; this traffic appeared extremely close and setup to t-bone us. I told the PF to the shallow the climb around 1;500' just as we got an RA to level off; followed by a 'monitor vertical speed' as I recall. I was fixated on the traffic but looked at my PFD briefly to notice a red target at our altitude; at our same location. We were at the same altitude when I lost sight of Aircraft Y; passed just behind us. We got up to 2;200; 'clear of conflict' and reported it to the controller. We then descended to 2;000' and continued the left turn to 160 deg heading per the Morristown 7 departure. Tower asked if we needed assistance and then passed us off to departure control. It was the closest RA I've experienced and really shook us up for a few minutes. Prior to takeoff we held short of the runway waiting for an IFR release nearly 20 minutes; why this controller felt he must thread the needle to get us out I don't know. We'd have gladly sat another 20 minutes to avoid an RA or worse. It was close. Spacing miss-judgement by Tower Controller If Tower gave us a no-delay clearance; we could have rejected it knowing we briefed a static takeoff. We were not given this that I recall. Perhaps if tower had assigned right hand traffic for 31 to those in the pattern; it could have been avoided.
Procedure,Aircraft had a history of requiring excessive left rudder trim. Signed off with adjustment of aileron Power Control Unit. On climbout; once clean; required 6.5 units left rudder. Cruise required 5 units; back up to 6+ on descent. Yoke centered and ailerons showing even on Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System. EPRs/N1s matched; and fuel balanced. Trim requirements reduced as we extended flaps; reaching zero by the time we had flaps 30. Wrote info report; debriefed maintenance; and aircraft was taken out of service in ZZZ.
Aircraft,At cruise after initial level off at FL320; all pages of all flight attendant Flight Safety Organization screens had Smoke Detect in red in the bottom left hand corner of the screen. No location was identified. We searched the plane for any signs of smoke; none was found anywhere; lavs; rest areas; etc. While the flight attendants continued to be alert; the cockpit crew called Dispatch and were patched through to the Chief Pilot and Operations. No one had heard of a Smoke Detect without a location. Making the situation more complex was the fact that we had lithium ion batteries in the bulk cargo along with acetone; two separate DG shipments. We also had a forward cargo fan deferred. It was decided that if we could not reset the Smoke Detect message to confirm if it was still active; we would divert to ZZZ. If there was indeed smoke detected; we were diverting to ZZZ1. At no point was smoke detected by the Flight Attendants. Operations offered a technique to reset the Flight Safety Organization panel; but it only reset the lighting and cabin temperature aspects of the system; it did not remove the smoke detect message from the screen.The flight attendants were fantastic throughout the event. We had three brand new flight attendants; the Purser has been working for [the] Company for 2 months. He handled the situation quite well. Name was particularly helpful. He researched the problem and found a reset in the manual. His problem was that the manual did not describe the location of the buttons suggested in the reset. He continued to search the cabin and found the buttons referenced at door 1R. I asked him to proceed with the reset procedure he found in his manual and the Smoke Detect message was cleared from all screens. The message did not reappear. Dispatch; the Chief Pilot; and Operations all agreed the situation was resolved and the flight continued to ZZZ2. The entire crew agreed and we continued uneventfully.All crew worked extremely well together; CRM was used throughout the entire event which lasted more than an hour. Name and Name 1 really saved the day on this one.
Human Factors,On the SAMMR3 Arrival ATC told us to expect the RNAV Z 26L. We requested RNAV Y 26L since we had already set up and reviewed it. ATC told us to expect that. Cleared us direct to BUSEY and descend to 8;000. The Captain and I thought we had been cleared for the approach and the Captain activated approach mode. We were already in the descent from cruise flight.  Since we were in APR mode the aircraft descend on the APR path through 8;000 feet.  About 5 miles from BUSEY ATC issued a low altitude alert and to check our altitude because we had descended below the MVA for the area. We were at approximately 7;200 feet. 800 below the assigned 8;000. We initiated a climb but were given a clearance to descend to 6;900 at BUSEY and cleared for the approach. Continued the approach and landed. Last leg of the day at night. Did not realize we had not been cleared for the approach; and that we were not yet on a published segment of the approach. Also conditions were VFR so we could have flown a visual. I think this lead to some complacency on my part. Also relatively new Captain and First officer. Verify that approach clearance was given before entering APR mode on FGC.
Aircraft,Whilst heading towards the initial approach fix level at 5;600 feet in partial IMC we got a terrain alert and initiated an immediate climb; notified ATC and leveled at 7;500 ft. We had been in icing conditions and still had rime ice on the windscreen and sensor. We were well within the 5;600 foot radar vectoring area and there was no terrain showing on the terrain page. We confirmed with ATC that were in fact clear of all and any terrain and descended back and joined the approach with no further incident. We were in fact at the correct vectoring altitude and correct location when the warning went off. Completed the safest / required option given the circumstance and climbed to a safe altitude 7;500 feet.
Aircraft,Aircraft X (ZZZ1 [to] ZZZ2) took-off from ZZZ1. I was working the forward FA (Flight Attendant) position; seated in the jump seat adjacent to the Main Cabin Door (MCD.) About 3 minutes after takeoff; approximately 1 minute before receiving the double chime indicating that the aircraft reached 10000 ft.; I heard a slight popping sound followed by a very loud whistling sound coming from the MCD. In my experience; this was a highly unusual sound; very different from the normal air noises that come from the door.Immediately upon reaching 10000 ft.; I called the flight deck. The Captain could hear the sound over the interphone and asked me what was that whistling noise; even before I had the chance to tell him. I explained the sequence of events to him and he said he would look into it and contact me back. A minute or two later; he did call back and told me that they were getting a reading in the cockpit that indicated low cabin pressure. He said they had leveled off at 10000 ft. and we're going to contact Dispatch about returning to ZZZ1. He then made an announcement to the passengers and informed them. I made a follow-up announcement to inform passengers that we were going to suspend service. Both FA's walked through the cabin to ensure that passengers were okay and to alleviate concerns and answer questions.After several more minutes; the CA (Captain) called us again with an update: we were currently in a holding pattern to burn off enough fuel to land. He told us that we did not have enough fuel to fly ZZZ2 and [had] too much fuel to land. He indicated that we were almost ready to start our approach and to prepare the cabin. He then made an announcement to the passengers with a similar update. We prepared the cabin; performed normal safety compliance checks; answered as many questions as we could; and returned to our jump seats for landing.After returning to ZZZ1 and arriving at the gate; we deplaned and informed [the] Passengers to stay near the gate area for updates on whether we were changing planes or not. Ultimately; we did swap planes and left ZZZ1. We arrived in ZZZ2 without any further incidents.
Aircraft,As we were setting up for our pre-arrival service; we were advised by the Purser that we were going to be diverting to due to a mechanical issue. The pilots had informed her that we were leaking oil and would have to shut down one engine and that we would need to land either in ZZZZ or ZZZZ1. She told us to put everything away and prepare for landing. She was told by the pilots that we did not need to prep for evacuation but to get the cabin ready for landing in ZZZZ1. We got the cabin ready and had a normal landing. After landing; we started taxiing to the gate and the pilot told us that the brakes had overheated and caused a small fire that was extinguished by the ground personnel. He said we would have to wait for an hour before proceeding to the gate to let the brakes cool down. We made sure all the doors were covered as we waited to taxi to the gate. After the hour; we taxied to the gate; deplaned the passengers and disembarked the aircraft.
Ambiguous,Shortly after beginning a turn from a 360 heading to 330 heading cruising at 12;000 ft. with the autopilot engaged; the aircraft began to encounter moderate turbulence. Within 10 seconds of encountering this moderate turbulence while in a 30 degree banked left turn; the autopilot suddenly disengaged uncommanded and the airplane rapidly began to bank towards the right. The PIC (Pilot in Command) (PF (Pilot Flying)) called out 'I got the controls' and commanded full left aileron. The airplane continued to increase the right bank until finally stopping at 40 degrees with a slight pitch up. The PIC continued holding full left aileron and the aircraft continued to hold a 40 degree right bank and stated 'I think we have a flight control problem.' Shortly after that within 15 seconds; the aircraft began to roll back to the left. As the aircraft returned to wings level attitude the PIC rolled out the left aileron to command a straight and level attitude. The turbulence had subsided at this time. This was held for a short while until we realized that during the event; we had climbed about 340 ft. The PIC then initiated a descent to return to 12;000. At 12;000 ft.; the PIC then initiated a left turn back to our assigned heading of 330. After observing that the airplane was responding correctly to flight control commands; we turned the autopilot on to test its functionality. The autopilot was able to hold altitude and heading with no abnormalities. During our initial climb out of FRG; I noticed a large aircraft that was flying east out of JFK at an altitude slightly above us while we were flying southeast. ATC turned them north and had them climb then had us climb above that initial altitude and turned us west to cross over their flight path then turned us northwest and cleared us to 12;000. Throughout this maneuvering we remained relatively close to that large aircraft and they remained at higher altitudes then us. That aircraft was a 747. They had flown 500 ft. above where we encountered this environment one minute prior as they were climbing to a higher altitude.Given that we had no flight control problems after recovering from the upset condition; the close proximity of a much larger aircraft; and the nature of the upset our aircraft experienced; this event was directly related to wake turbulence.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,I was working the arrival rush ILS approaches to Runway XXL. I had numerous aircraft being vectored for the ILS. ZZZ1 [Center] gave me 4 aircraft inbound from the west. This is not unusual for evening arrivals. I had to break Aircraft X off the approach for compression on final. I canceled the approach clearance and issued a left turn heading 010 maintain six thousand. The aircraft looked like they were making a right turn. The pilot asked what heading I gave him. I told him that it looked like he was in a right turn and issued a heading of 190. I had Aircraft Y at seven thousand on the right downwind. I then issued a heading of 250 to Aircraft X to allow for final spacing then a turn of 280 degrees. I turned Aircraft Y to 070 heading and had them join the LOC. I then issued a 010 heading to Aircraft X. They were east of the 062 MVA. Aircraft X did not respond I attempted to establish communications with Aircraft X. Both approach frequencies; guard frequency; and also broadcasted in the blind for Aircraft X to ident if he could hear me. I also broadcasted climb immediately in the blind for Aircraft X. The Tower Supervisor suggested I have Aircraft Y relay for me. I had Aircraft Y [reach] out to Aircraft X. Aircraft Y could communicate with Aircraft X I instructed Aircraft X to climb and maintain 080 and fly northbound away from higher terrain. Once Aircraft X reached 080 they could communicate with me. I vectored them back to the localizer and cleared them for the approach. We have a known communication limitation to the south west of ZZZ. It usually does not affect aircraft within 30 miles of the airport. In this incident I believe there may be an issue with our communication equipment.
ATC Equipment / Nav Facility / Buildings,ZZZ Tower is closed; they set the localizer to Runway XXR. Winds were strong from the west. Aircraft X checked in going to ZZZ IFR. I asked him to verify he had the weather and which approach he'd like. He confirmed he had the weather and initially he responded with the RNAV Y [Runway] XXL; which was available; so I continued him inbound for the approach and used my data block entries that reminded me I had everything I needed to clear him for the approach. He later stated he was unable to do the RNAV and needed the Localizer to XYL; which was unavailable. I failed to recognize the LOC XYL was unavailable. I cleared him for the LOC XYL and after he appeared established on the course; changed him to advisories. After about 2 miles; he appeared to be slightly off course; I gave a low altitude alert; in the chance he was still on frequency. I'm not sure if he received it; but very shortly after checked back in executing a go around. He attempted the approach one more time with a similar result. He ended up diverting back to ZZZ1 and landing there.If the procedure is for ZZZ to set the localizer to Runway XYR at closing even when the winds strongly favor the runway XY's; we could just have the LOC XYL NOTAM'd out of service for the hours the Tower is not in operation. That way the flight crew would know of the situation. As it stands now; this operation has a single point of failure in the controller working the ZZZ approaches.
Aircraft,Passing approximately FL230; felt abrupt aircraft shudder. Noted Engine #2; EGT box flashing red at 977 degrees. [Requested priority handling]; ran appropriate checklists; secured engine; computed landing data. Returned to departure airport. Made uneventful flaps 15 landing. Accomplished Brake Cooling module. Aircraft inspected by ZZZ Fire Department visually and with brake temperature measuring. Taxied to gate uneventfully. Completed phone call with Dispatcher; Dispatch; and Maintenance Control. Debriefed and comforted Flight Attendants and First Officer.
Aircraft,We departed [Runway] XXL in ZZZ. Shortly after departure; we were cleared direct ZZZZZ and climb to FL210. About 6000 ft. MSL; the First Officer; Pilot Flying; began adding rudder trim. A few seconds later; the auto-throttles disengaged and the aircraft began to increase yaw. We looked at the number 2 engine instruments and saw N1 gauge about 55 percent and Fuel Flow around 3000 pounds per hour. EEC's (Electronic Engine Control) were normal. We leveled off at 9000 ft. and began to assess the situation. The amber ENG FAIL annunciator appeared on the upper Display Unit. I called for the Engine Failure Checklist in the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook). I requested priority handling with ZZZ departure and requested radar vectors while we ran checklists. We notified Dispatch; through ZZZ Operations; communicated with the Flight Attendants and notified the passengers that we were returning to ZZZ for a mechanical issue. Landing data was acquired; one engine inoperative flaps 15 landing. Auto Brakes 3 were selected. Once landing data and the Engine Failure Checklist was complete; up to the one Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist; the First Officer transferred the controls to me for the landing. Flaps 15 landing was made uneventful. We stopped the aircraft in order to have ARF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting) assess the condition of the aircraft and run brake cooling numbers. We were given the all clear by ARF. Brake cooling allowed us to taxi to the gate. Maintenance met the aircraft and a logbook entry was made. After aircraft was deplaned; I had a conference call with the Chief Pilot on call; Dispatch; Maintenance Control; and Manager.
Aircraft,Smoke and fumes in cabin. [Requested priority handling] and returned to ZZZ.
Human Factors,The situation involved dangerous goods being boarded; and a 'final dangerous goods summary' being sent to the flight deck approximately 1 hour before departure. The summary shows 'final' (see attached) however it is in the same format as the 'planned dangerous goods summary' on FOM). This does not include who loaded the goods or that the employee confirmed that the packages were not damaged; leaking; or labeled for cargo aircraft only. After querying the station; Lead Ramp Agent; and Dispatch 10 minutes before pushback; a correct (per FOM) final dangerous goods summary (see attached) was sent 15 minutes after scheduled departure. This is the third report I have filed for the same type situation in ZZZ. In addition; the pre departure service message showed water and lav service needed; but our onboard water waste indicator showed it had been completed.
Aircraft,We were operating from ZZZ1-ZZZ2 on Date and had a possible altitude deviation during our descent due to an automation issue with the aircraft while on descent on the STAR. The flight was the second segment of the pairing and prior to this event we had no issues with the flight to ZZZ1 with the same aircraft. While in ZZZ1; I noticed the high forecasted winds out of the west in ZZZ2 and decided to add 10 minutes of extra fuel for any unforseen delays. After receiving our clearance we were notified of a 40 minute EDCT (estimated departure clearance time) due to the winds in ZZZ2. I made a quick phone call to Dispatch to confer and verify that the winds were the reason for the EDCT. We worked on a plan to push 10 minutes later from the gate; which would allow time for a Southeast Taxi and possible 5-10 minute delay at the end of the departure runway prior to being cleared for takeoff if everything went right. Everything did go as planned and shortly after takeoff we received an ACARS message from Dispatch alerting us to possible 20-30 minute hold times inbound to ZZZ2 due to winds. Upon reaching cruise altitude we formed a contingency plan between ourselves and also advised Dispatch of our limited hold ability. We were nearing our descent phase of the flight and as per my preflight FA (flight attendants) and PAX brief; I had briefed our FA on the ground that we would be seating them early and to have everything stowed with the FA in their jumpsuits at least 30 minutes prior to arrival. We took one final break about 50 minutes out and I reconfirmed with the FA that they were to finish up within 20 minutes and be in their jumpseats in anticipation of the reported turbulence in our descent. The rest of the flight went well till the shortly after we started our final descent.During our brief we had planned for the contingencies of what we would do if we had to land on a north runway with gusty crosswinds. My First Officer was a probationary pilot and was the flying pilot. Given he had prior experience in gusty crosswind landings in the aircraft; but was still relatively new; we agreed that if crosswinds were 30kts or greater on a North runway I would land the aircraft as that was his personal comfort level; however if they were less than that or if it was a West landing runway my FO (first officer) would land the aircraft. After briefing the approach for Runway XX; covering contingencies for multiple runways and finishing our descent checklist we started our descent into ZZZ2 on a Descend VIA the ZZZZZ RNAV landing North about 5 minutes later. We rechecked the landing data and current winds and saw that the winds were around 23 kts crosswind for Runway XXR and I asked my FO how comfortable he felt with that to which he said he was comfortable landing in those conditions. I told my FO to continue as the pilot flying in that case and I would do the runway change in the FMC. We were somewhere in the mid FL200 and started into the light to occasional moderate turbulence at this point while we were somewhere just prior to ZZZZZ; perhaps less than 5 miles ZZZZZ; when we had the automation issue with the aircraft right before I could do a runway change. We were in FMC SPD/VNAV PATH per our FMA with a bottom altitude of 11000 ft. in the altitude selector and around 280kts when suddenly the our autopilot disconnect alert came on and we found ourselves in CWS (Control Wheel Steering) and CWP (Control Wheel Panel) modes and both of our flight directors missing as we approached ZZZZZ intersection. After the initial startle factor I told my FO to hand fly the arrival while I tried to trouble shoot the issue. I believe my FO initially tried re-engaging the CMD B autopilot first when this happened; followed by my trying to re-engaging VNAV/LNAV with no luck. I then tried a quick reset of the Flight Directors (and noted the Captain side would not take the master leading me to wonder if it was a CA (captain) side FCC issue) which did not work either. During this time my FO told me he didn't know if he could make the altitude restriction at ZZZZZ as we were somewhat high so I called ATC and asked for altitude relief due to a flight computer issue. We were given the relief as well as offered any assistance such as a heading if needed. Other than being higher than planned profile due to the startle factor we seemed to have everything under control so I advised ATC we would let him know if we needed further assistance but okay for now. At this point I told my FO I was going to check the QRH (Quick Reference Handbook) real quick too see if I could find a quick solution only to quickly remember my iPad was at less than 15% (while in dark mode and remaining off most of the flight) due to the fact that the aircraft had no USB charging port and that the only power charging station was behind my FO head. I had been charging my iPad during our 50 minute turn and during our flight but it never went above 30%. My FO also stated his iPad started at 100% as well and while plugged in the entire flight he was already at 30% battery life. I quickly grabbed the paper QRH; did a quick search and did not see anything immediately that would help us solve the issue without more trouble shooting. Given my long day; fatigue starting to set in and the time of the situation I put the QRH back and told my FO to just continue hand flying the aircraft as it was probably going to take too much time to find the right section of the QRH with the turbulence and workload level of our flight. After putting the paper QRH away I then asked my FO if we would like to try level change at least while manual setting in the altitudes to see if that would do anything; to which he responded yes. Once I hit level change our vertical guidance on the flight director came back and noticing that; I engaged heading and our lateral guidance came back as well. I asked my FO if he was comfortable with me engaging LNAV/VNAV to see if it would re-engage and after his concurrence I did. We then recovered our Flight Detector and were able to re-engage our autopilot. After taking a few moments to make sure we were where we were supposed to be and doing what what we were supposed to do on the arrival; I finally had a moment to ask my FO if he would like me to load up runway change again. After his concurrence I did the runway change; verified the changes with my FO and hit execute. Once again; right around ZZZZZ intersection; our FD disappeared and the autopilot disconnect alerts chimed and we were also once again in CWS/CWP. We quickly went to LVL CHG and HDG selected followed by LNAV/VNAV to bring our flight directors back up followed by re-engaging the CMB B autopilot once we had made sure the aircraft was doing what it was supposed to be doing on the arrival. After this we decide if we had any other issues we would just hand fly the aircraft for the remainder of the flight. The rest of the flight went without incident as were just about finished with the STAR and told to expect vectors for a visual to XXR
Aircraft,This was actually 2 fume events. At the gate at ZZZ we were using the start cart for air conditioning. We switched over to PCA (Preconditioned Air)  because we thought the start cart fumes were getting ingested. Fast forward 3 hours later to the Arrival and we had just crossed ZZZZZ. We were cleared out of 12000 ft.; power came back at we got very strong fumes. FO (First Officer) suggested we go on oxygen and [request priority handling]. FO became the Pilot Flying and I coordinated with the FAs (flight attendants) and Operations. FO coordinated with ATC. We declined XXR due to last minutes changes and we had our mask on. We landed; [were given] the all clear and we taxied to the gate.Found out that the APU that was on a placard had lots of contamination that was injested into the compressor and into the plane. The engines at idle with the hp bleed opening was believed to be the causeMore checks possibly needed when an APU goes out of service.
Aircraft,I was Pilot Monitoring (PM); and the First Officer was Pilot Flying (PF) for this leg from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. While climbing between FL200 and FL210; the HYD 3 LO PRESS MASTER CAUTION presented on the EICAS (engine indicating and crew alerting system) primary page. I immediately viewed the HYD synoptic page which indicated a complete loss of hydraulic fluid in system 3 (0%). We made a request to ATC to level off at FL230; explaining that we were having a malfunction with the hydraulic system and would have to accomplish checklists. I transferred radio communications to the First Officer; who was the flying pilot; and I accomplished the appropriate QRH (quick reference handbook) check list (HYD 3 LO PRESS: 4-12). After the QRH items were complete; I declared priority with ATC; indicating that; while we would be conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance; it was our present intention to continue to ZZZ2. I asked the First Officer to decelerate from 280 KTS to 250 KTS to mitigate higher fuel consumption at a lower than planned cruising altitude. I sent an ACARS message to Dispatch and Maintenance; explaining the malfunction and our intentions. I then informed the Flight Attendants to prepare the cabin for a Yellow Level priority; the nature of the priority; and the time remaining (30 minutes). I also informed them that the aircraft would be coming to a complete stop on the runway; would be unable to taxi off; and to expect a tug to tow the aircraft to our gate. Finally; I informed them to expect a firmer than normal landing. We received a response from Dispatch indicating that they were in accord with the decision to continue to ZZZ2 and asking if any other aircraft systems were malfunctioning as well. We replied that only those components associated with Hydraulic System 3 were effected. I then made a passenger announcement; explaining that hydraulic pressure was lost in one of our hydraulic systems and that this malfunction would require us; after landing; to be towed off the runway by a vehicle similar to the vehicle that pushes the aircraft from the gate. I also informed them to expect a landing that is more firm than they might normally be accustomed to. Finally; I requested that the passengers pay close attention to the instructions of the Flight Attendants. We then informed ATC that we would require a minimum of a 15 mile final for Runway XXR; (the longest available runway); and that we would be unable to vacate the runway after landing; but were coordinating with the company to be towed from the runway. ATC acknowledged and also indicated that ARFF (airport rescue and firefighting) would be standing by. All standard briefings and checklists were accomplished. Special attention was given to calculating; verifying; and briefing the approach speed; landing distance; flap setting (20 degrees); and manual gear extension. We also briefed the need for continuous brake application to bring the aircraft to a stop due to the use of accumulator pressure. We were configured; flaps 20; after having intercepted the localizer at a speed of 180KTS. Before glideslope intercept I verified and pulled the landing gear manual release handle and confirmed that both the main landing gear and the nose landing gear were all in the down and locked position. The First Officer slowed to the calculated Vref speed +5 for flaps 20 and we accomplished the Landing Checklist. The First Officer did an exceptional job maintaining the stabilized approach criteria at the appropriate speeds; achieved Vref by 50 feet; flared appropriately; made a normal touchdown at an appropriate rate of descent; and applied the brakes continuously and smoothly. To the passengers; the landing would have felt normal. After the aircraft was brought to a stop and the parking brake was set; the timer was started to shut down an engine. I made a PA; telling the passengers to remain seated with their seat belts securely fastened. The aircraft was immediately met by the tow vehicle andwe were given a discrete frequency to communicate directly with them. We informed the ground crew that; due to a deferred APU; we would be required to leave the right engine running while under tow. After the two minutes had elapsed we shut down the left engine. Shortly thereafter the tow vehicle had captured the aircraft and we were towed to the gate; completing all normal checklists when appropriate. Hydraulic System 3 lost all hydraulic fluid in flight.
Aircraft,While enroute from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2 at FL240; we received a Master Warning and Check Fire Detection indication of an APU Fire. After looking over the checklist; we noticed the APU panel had the 'BTL LOW' light illuminated; suggesting the system automatically blew the fire protection bottle. We didn't know the extent of the situation so we decided to treat it as priority and divert. We were about 40 miles east of ZZZ3 at the time; so we declared priority; called for the trucks; and began our diversion. The Captain made his required calls while I flew the plane and loaded the box. Upon landing; the fire trucks checked out the plane and determined there was no indication of fire. We proceeded with a normal taxi to the gate and deplaned. After Maintenance completed their inspections; they found no evidence to suggest there was a real fire.  As far as I know; we did everything we could to address the situation. The checklist didn't apply very accurately to the situation since we don't run the APU in flight; but still ran through it as well as we could. We didn't have any exceedances and we were below our max landing weight.I'd say the biggest lesson I learned is that sometimes strange things can occur that you can't really train for. In this case; the checklist wasn't much help because the APU wasn't running. In a situation like this; we needed to use the information we had to get the plane on the ground as safely and efficiently as we could. It was also a reminder to be aware of the best diversion options while en route. The Captain knew exactly where we should go which allowed for a safe and immediate diversion. In the future; I plan to think more intentionally as to where the best diversion location would be.
Ambiguous,On approach to Runway 16R; at approximately 1500 MSL; we responded to a traffic RA due to rapidly climbing traffic off of Boeing field. We were in VMC conditions and executed a missed approach after complying with the TCAS climb resolution advisory due to traffic. The traffic appeared to be within 300 feet of our altitude at the closest point. No injuries or limitations were reported or exceeded; and we landed normally.
Aircraft,While climbing out of ZZZ on the ZZZZZ departure from Runway XXL while climbing we noticed abnormal cabin altitude climb rate. We proceeded to reference the aircraft QRH. Upon reaching a cabin altitude at around 7500 ft. we advised ATC and leveled off. The Cabin altitude reached around 10;700 ft. We followed ATC instructions and proceeded to land Runway XXL.
Ambiguous,During landing RALT 2 fail EICAS (engine indicating and crew alerting system) message popped up. Possible 5G interference. Wrote up in Maintenance can. We were landing Stadium Visual 29.
Human Factors,On final approach to RWY 29 on the Harbor Visual; I got low inside the final approach fix. Received a ground proximity warning as I re-intercepted the glide slope. Maintained proper configuration and stability limits prior to 500 ft. Should possibly create altitudes along the visual to follow prior to intercepting any backup approach.
Aircraft,Before we left the airport in ZZZ1 the Captain briefed us that it was going to be a bumpy ride and not get up at 10;000 feet because it was going to be difficult to find clear air. At XA:55 AM the Captain called us and told us that there was an issue with the landing gear but it was still a yellow level priority because they had another mechanism to open them up. He advised us that we needed to prepare the cabin for a yellow level priority; that we would be met by priority vehicles upon landing and we had approximately 30 minutes. I was working forward. I looked up the yellow level check list in the FAM (Flight Attendant Manual) and made the announcement while the Aft came up because we had found smooth air and took out the priority checklist. The aft only had the water evacuation card however. Around XB:02 the Captain made an announcement informing the passengers of the situation at hand. Some passengers asked about service and I made announcement explaining that due to the nature of the flight we would not be doing a service. I briefed row 1 and 2A on how to use the doors and my seatbelt in case the priority escalated to a red level. 1A was a little shocked at first but I further explained that I did not believe these actions will be necessary I just wanted us to be as prepared as possible and she was OK after that. At XC:18 the captain announced that we had 15 minutes until landing and that we should expect a firmer landing than normal. We prepared the cabin for arrival and got into our seats reviewing [company procedures] and silently going over the evacuation commands in regular brace position. I could hear some error messages coming from the FD (Flight Deck) but the gear finally deployed and the landing was smoother than some of the normal landings I've experienced. Once we were on the ground the Captain announced for everyone to remain seated until parked at the gate and then they turned off an engine while we waited for them to pull us to a gate. When deplaning many passengers complimented the pilots and us getting us to ZZZ2 safely.
Weather,I was doing a re-qualification OE (Operational Experience) with a Check Airman. He was PF (Pilot Flying) in the right seat. We briefed windshear and the escape procedure as a precaution when we briefed the approach. We received a GPWS warning at 700 ft. Although it was windy and turbulent; I did not expect a GPWS warning even though we had briefed for windshear. We went around. A very busy go-around. Large airspeed fluctuations. We had a flap overspeed; which was unavoidable due to a large gust. We came up with a plan if we went around again. The next approach went well and we landed. The post flight report actually showed 5000 fpm down at 700 ft.
Human Factors,Just before departure; I received one of the newer NOTAC (Dangerous Goods Form) stating we were carrying two fire extinguishers. The airbill # was XXX-XXXXXXXX. I kept one copy and returned the other to the Ops Agent. Since I hadn't seen the new forms yet; I looked in my EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) for information and looked in the Manual. I found the relevant sections detailing the new form and when it was required. During cruise; I looked over the form again and saw a note in the corner saying that a note was required to be on the Release indicating Dispatch was aware of the HAZMAT and it was entered on the Dispatch Release for tracking purposes. Since this had not been done; when we landed I called Dispatch and we conferred. He said there was nothing to be done at that point and so I am filing a report as my action.
Human Factors,We were cleared to push straight back from Gate X and then Aircraft Y; a 787; was cleared to push from Gate Y. We were pushed tail to tail with a wind of 20 knots from around 130 degrees giving the 787 a right quartering headwind. We started without knowing the position of the 787 and called for taxi. We were told to hold. The 787 started and his exhaust was injected by our engines and filled the entire aircraft with fumes. By the time we realized this; it was too late to turn off our packs. I asked ramp to taxi around to the south line to get out of the fumes but was informed that I would not be allowed until the 787 push crew was disconnected. I informed ramp of the fume event and was told that this is the way they do it; and I would have to wait. The total disregard from ramp was a big factor. We could have moved at minimal power; or the priority of push could have been established before pushing and one of us could have waited at the gate.Pushing tail to tail is not safe and should not be continued especially with a strong wind from a starting aircraft. Ramp should be able to use good judgement in these situations; and should listen to crew concerns.
Weather,Slightly below V1; the aircraft had an uncommanded yaw to the right similar to that experienced in simulator engine failure training. Instinctively; I initiated the reject. Shortly after initiation; I heard the FO (First Officer) call out 'V1.' I used full reverse and the auto-brakes engaged at max. We slowed to a taxi speed straight ahead on the runway and exited onto the parallel taxiway. I made a PA to the passengers briefly explaining the situation; but missed the 'Remain Seated' PA because I forgot that it applied to a Rejected Take-Off as well as an evacuation that was subsequently cancelled. We stayed on Tower frequency initially; but then switched to a discreet frequency to communicate with ARFF (Airport Rescue and Firefighting). I had ARFF inspect the plane for any damage. Initial contact with them was a little confusing as we seemed to be missing each other on the new frequency. Eventually; I was able to talk to ARFF and they found some wear on the number 4 tire; but no other aircraft damage. Due to this communication confusion as well as coordinating with ARFF; I didn't contact the flight attendants until the number 1 called me to ensure that we were remaining onboard. He was very calm and was just checking on the situation.We coordinated with ARFF; ZZZ1 Operations; and Ground to taxi back to the gate. Brake temps peaked at 575 [degrees] and cooled quickly after turning on the brake fans. Maintenance met us at the gate and determined that no aircraft faults were present and that the number 4 tire required changing and suspected the wear was from the abort.My assumption after the fact is that the yaw was caused by a wind gust; but the magnitude was beyond anything I've ever experienced hence the split-second decision to abort. In retrospect; the instinctual nature of my to abort decision is a little surprising and a testament to our training. In that kind of a situation; there is no time to analyze and it's good to know that the reactions trained into us lean on the side of safety. [This was] gusty winds that exceeded my previous experience.
Human Factors,We were on arrival into DEN on the AALLE3 arrival; just passing the fix 'DOGGG' at 11;000; and Approach Control gave us descend and maintain 8000; we responded with the same instruction and descended to 8000. While we were descending Approach said there was wind hear advisors in effect and that there had been multiple go arounds. The frequency was congested and other aircraft were being called by Approach Control to speed up for spacing and aircraft were responding with unable. Approach Control responded that she was trying to space out all aircraft to give everyone a chance for approach to land. Approach Control called us and instructed us to descend and maintain 6;500 feet and my FO (First Officer) repeated the clearance; at this time the approach Controller 'did not' reply with an altitude correction or change. Approach Control instructed us to turn heading 270 and slow to 190 knots; my FO repeated the instruction. I increased my descent to 2;000 feet per minute and made the right turn to 270; however my speed was increasing to 220 so I extended the spoilers to slow to 190. I reached up to slow my descent rate; and I realized autopilot did not capture 6;500 feet; I looked down and my speed was decreasing to 185-190 knots. The low speed indicator increased with the stall margin indicator; and we got the terrain warning once and I immediately and simultaneously; disconnected autopilot and got a momentary stick shaker. I stowed the spoilers; added max thrust; and leveled for a split second and as speed increased with no drag I initiated a climb up to 7;500 feet. I advised my FO to tell Approach we were correcting; Approach was calling to confirm our altitude and advise us that we should be at 7;500 feet and they received a low altitude alert for us. My FO advised approach that we were climbing to 7;500 and Approach responded with everyone watch their altitudes; and advised us to turn heading 325; and maintain 150 knots until FRONZ and cleared us for the visual to 35R. My FO repeated the clearance. The winds were extremely gusty and our turn was wider with the strong winds and windshear. At this time the intercept heading came to late from approach; and I overshot the approach course and I was already in a turn to re-intercept the approach course. We intercepted the course; and were configuring to be stabilized by the final approach fix FRONZ. We were fully configured and stable by FRONZ and approach instructed us to contact Tower; Tower cleared us to land. After being cleared to land; we encountered windshear caution; but continued and then Tower called and advised us to expect a loss of 30 knots at 150 feet; we continued and made a safe landing on Runway 35R.I believe the cause of this event was due to Approach giving us an altitude of 6;500 feet; a heading instruction and speed reduction instruction. I believe the terrain warning which alerted Approach; was due to an aggressive descent rate with autopilot connected at a low altitude. I believe the stick shaker was caused by the fully extended spoilers which I had extended to slow to 190 knots per approaches speed restriction and my aggressive pitch up attitude to level off at 6;500 feet. We became immediately task saturated with a congested frequency we were not able to query in time. I could have requested my FO query Approach about the altitude restriction; and I could have requested to slow early and decreased my descent rate. In the future; I will take the initiative exercise my authority in having my FO's query about instructions given by ATC to insure no miscommunications; and prevent task saturation; which will allow greater focus of the whole environment.
Aircraft,On initial takeoff and upon achieving a positive rate of climb; I went to retract the landing gear and the gear handle would not move. I verified all circuit breakers were in. I attempted to move the gear handle up; out and up; and nothing would allow it to move. I moved the gear lock release located next to the handle and still could not get the gear to retract. At this time I contacted Dispatch and asked for an air return. Then Notified ATC and they gave me vectors for landing on XXL and ZZZ. Landed and taxied back to the cutter Ramp without incident. Unsure. Maintenance had just performed maintenance on the gear handle sub panel for the landing gear lights. This could be a contributing factor. Or; I simply missed the operation of something. Though; I'm not sure what that could be. I have never had a landing gear handle fail to move before. Attempt to trouble shoot by checking circuit breakers and trying to move the handle many times and different ways to no avail. I am not sure. Some how being able to check gear operation before flight. That doesn't seem realistic or practical for every flight. So; I'm not sure. Open to suggestions.
Aircraft,After exiting the runway we started APU. There was a delay in gate assignment due to congestion in ZZZ. Shortly after a normal APU start; the FA2 (Flight Attendant) heard a loud 'pop' followed by oily odor in the aft part of the cabin. The FA1 alerted the flight crew of the smell in the cabin. The EICAS filled up with messages. We shut down the APU and the odor cleared immediately although the EICAS messages all remained. Shortly thereafter our gate opened up and we taxied in uneventfully. Maintenance was notified.
Weather,We had deviated around the southern end of a line of thunderstorms then made the turn in the general direction of Chicago. We were then paralleling the storm by about 40 miles. It was a bit of a choppy ride so we requested a right deviation to get some more distance between us and the line of storms in hopes of a better ride. We were about 60 miles east of the line now and encountered what I would classify as moderate turbulence with a very strong updraft to it. Vertical speed increased to over 2000 FPM and aircraft banked 20-25 degrees right and the autopilot disconnected. Captain was Pilot Flying and took controls and leveled the wings and stopped it from climbing. I notified ATC as we were about 500 ft. above our assigned altitude at this point. ATC informed us we had traffic at FL340 below and kept querying us to see if we were out of it yet. I informed him we were still in it. Captain was maintaining the attitude while we were riding out the drafts. Lasted about 45 seconds to a minute and then ride improved. We were +500 -0 on our assigned altitude throughout the event.
