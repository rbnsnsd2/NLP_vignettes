# A short course on natural language processing in Python
NLP Vignettes is an introductory course on NLP that quickly goes from basic vectorization to deep neural networks with *tensorflow*. It's certainly not comprehensive, but then again this isn't the size of a career's work.
Everything here is written in Python, which is an excellent tool for doing just this. For serving such machines for *production* use, I would suggest the choice of another language.
